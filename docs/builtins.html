<a id="typechecks"></a><h2>Checking the type of a value</h2>
<p>Dialog contains a set of built-in predicates for checking if a value is of a
particular type. They are:
</p>
<p class="codeline">(number $X)</p>
<p class="noteline">Succeeds if and only if <span class="code">$X</span> is bound to a number.
</p>
<p class="codeline">(word $X)</p>
<p class="noteline">Succeeds if and only if <span class="code">$X</span> is bound to a dictionary word.
</p>
<p class="codeline">(empty $X)</p>
<p class="noteline">Succeeds if and only if <span class="code">$X</span> is bound to an empty list.
</p>
<p class="codeline">(nonempty $X)</p>
<p class="noteline">Succeeds if and only if <span class="code">$X</span> is bound to a non-empty list.
</p>
<p class="codeline">(list $X)</p>
<p class="noteline">Succeeds if and only if <span class="code">$X</span> is bound to a list (empty or non-empty).
</p>
<p class="codeline">(bound $X)</p>
<p class="noteline">Succeeds if and only if <span class="code">$X</span> is bound to anything. That is,
the predicate only fails if <span class="code">$X</span> is an unbound variable. It
succeeds for numbers, dictionary words, and lists, including lists with
one or more unbound variables inside.
</p>
<p>The last one comes with an extra feature:
</p>
<p class="codeline">(object $X)</p>
<p class="noteline">If <span class="code">$X</span> is bound to an object, the query succeeds. If it is
bound to anything else, the query fails. But if <span class="code">$X</span> is
unbound, <span class="code">*(object $X)</span> backtracks over every object in the
game.
</p>
<a id="arithmetic"></a><h2>Numbers and arithmetic</h2>
<p>The Dialog language is designed for symbolic manipulation, predicate logic, and
storytelling. Arithmetic is possible, but the syntax is rather clunky.
</p>
<p class="codeline">($A plus $B into $C)</p>
<p class="noteline"><span class="code">A</span> and <span class="code">B</span> must be bound to numbers;
<span class="code">C</span> is unified with their sum. If the result is outside the
valid range of numbers, the query fails.
</p>
<p class="codeline">($A minus $B into $C)</p>
<p class="noteline"><span class="code">A</span> and <span class="code">B</span> must be bound to numbers;
<span class="code">C</span> is unified with their difference.  If the result is
outside the valid range of numbers, the query fails.
</p>
<p class="codeline">($A times $B into $C)</p>
<p class="noteline"><span class="code">A</span> and <span class="code">B</span> must be bound to numbers;
<span class="code">C</span> is unified with their product. If the product is outside
the valid range of numbers, the query succeeds, but the numeric result
is unpredictable (i.e. it depends on the interpreter).
</p>
<p class="codeline">($A divided by $B into $C)</p>
<p class="noteline"><span class="code">A</span> and <span class="code">B</span> must be bound to numbers;
<span class="code">C</span> is unified with the (integer) quotient after dividing
<span class="code">A</span> by <span class="code">B</span>. The query fails if <span class="code">B</span> is
zero.
</p>
<p class="codeline">($A modulo $B into $C)</p>
<p class="noteline"><span class="code">A</span> and <span class="code">B</span> must be bound to numbers;
<span class="code">C</span> is unified with the remainder after dividing
<span class="code">A</span> by <span class="code">B</span>. The query fails if <span class="code">B</span> is
zero.
</p>
<p class="codeline">(random from $A to $B into $C)</p>
<p class="noteline"><span class="code">A</span> and <span class="code">B</span> must be bound to numbers, such that
<span class="code">B</span> is greater than or equal to <span class="code">A</span>. A random
number in the range <span class="code">A</span> to <span class="code">B</span> (inclusive) is
picked, and then unified with <span class="code">C</span>.
</p>
<p class="codeline">($A &lt; $B)</p>
<p class="noteline">This predicate succeeds if and only if <span class="code">A</span> is numerically
less than <span class="code">B</span>.
</p>
<p class="codeline">($A &gt; $B)</p>
<p class="noteline">This predicate succeeds if and only if <span class="code">A</span> is numerically
greater than <span class="code">B</span>.
</p>
<p>Common to all of the above predicates is that they fail if <span class="code">A</span> or
<span class="code">B</span> is unbound, or bound to a non-number. <span class="code">C</span> may be
bound or unbound; it is unified with the result of the computation.
</p>
<p>To check for numerical equality, use regular unification, i.e. <span class="code">($&nbsp;=
$)</span>.
</p>
<p>All numbers in Dialog are restricted to the range <span class="nobreak">0&ndash;16383</span>
(inclusive). This range directly supports four-digit numbers such as years and
PIN codes. Pocket money should be fairly straightforward to implement by
counting in cents; story authors (or library developers) that require more
sophisticated number crunching will have to get creative.
</p>
<a id="trace"></a><h2>Debugging</h2>
<p>The following built-in predicates are useful for debugging:
</p>
<p class="codeline">(log) <i>statement</i></p>
<p class="noteline">If the program is currently running inside the interactive debugger,
execute the statement—usually a block—in a stoppable environment.
Output from the statement will appear between line breaks, in a
distinct style. This is useful for adding temporary printouts to the
code.
</p>
<p class="codeline">(breakpoint)</p>
<p class="noteline">If the program is currently running inside the interactive debugger,
suspend execution and print the current source code filename and line
number. When execution resumes, this query succeeds.
</p>
<p class="noteline">If the program is running on the Z-machine, the query simply succeeds.
</p>
<p class="codeline">(trace on)</p>
<p class="noteline">Enables tracing. Following this, debugging information will be printed
when queries are made, and when rule bodies are entered. The
interactive debugger will also report when solutions are found, and
when dynamic predicates are updated.
</p>
<p class="codeline">(trace off)</p>
<p class="noteline">Disables tracing.
</p>
<p>If your program source code contains a query to <span class="code">(trace on)</span>
anywhere, the Z-machine backend will insert extra instructions all over the
generated code, to deal with tracing. This is known as <i>instrumenting</i> the
code, and it makes the program slower and larger. Thus, you'll only want to use
these predicates temporarily, during debugging. The compiler prints a warning
when it adds the extra instructions.
</p>
<p>Please be aware that the Dialog compiler and debugger do optimize your program,
and you will be tracing the optimized code, so certain queries and rules will
be missing from the debug printouts. You will generally want to do all your
tracing in the debugger, which mercifully turns off some of the more confusing
optimizations. That being said, tracing the optimized Z-code is highly useful
when trying to speed up a program.
</p>
<a id="system"></a><h2>System control</h2>
<p>The following built-in predicates offer low-level control over the interpreter
and the Dialog runtime. This is decidedly in the domain of library code, so
story authors rarely need to worry about these predicates.
</p>
<p class="codeline">(quit)</p>
<p class="noteline">Immediately terminates the program. This predicate neither fails nor
succeeds.
</p>
<p class="codeline">(restart)</p>
<p class="noteline">Resets the program to its initial state. The only part of the game
state that may survive a restart is the state of the output machinery
(including the current style and on-screen contents, and whether the
transcript feature is on or off). If the operation succeeds, execution
resumes from the start of the program. If there is an error, or the
interpreter doesn't support restarting, execution continues normally,
i.e. the query succeeds.
</p>
<p class="codeline">(save $ComingBack)</p>
<p class="noteline">Attempts to save the current game state to a file. The interpreter
takes care of asking the player for a filename. In the event of a save
error, or if the operation was cancelled, the query fails. On success,
the parameter is unified with&nbsp;0 if we just saved the state, and with&nbsp;1
if we just restored the state from a file saved by this query.
</p>
<p class="codeline">(restore)</p>
<p class="noteline">Attempts to restore the current game state from a file. The interpreter
takes care of asking the player for a filename. The only part of the
game state that may survive a restore is the state of the output
machinery (including the current style and on-screen contents, and
whether the transcript feature is on or off). If the operation
succeeds, execution resumes after the query from which the save file
was written. Otherwise, in the event of a load error or if the
operation was cancelled, execution continues normally, i.e. the query
succeeds.
</p>
<p class="codeline">(save undo $ComingBack)</p>
<p class="noteline">Works just like <span class="code">(save&nbsp;$)</span>, but stores the game state in a
buffer in memory. This operation is typically invoked once per move.
</p>
<p class="codeline">(undo)</p>
<p class="noteline">Works like <span class="code">(restore)</span>, but restores the game state from the
undo buffer. If there is no saved undo state, the predicate fails. If
there's some other problem&mdash;such as the interpreter imposing a limit
on the number of undo states that are retained in memory&mdash;the
predicate succeeds, and execution continues normally.
</p>
<p class="codeline">(interpreter supports quit)</p>
<p class="noteline">Succeeds if and only if the current interpreter handles
<span class="code">(quit)</span> in a way that is meaningful to the player. For
instance, it fails under the Å-machine web interpreter, because a web
page cannot close itself.
</p>
<p class="codeline">(interpreter supports undo)</p>
<p class="noteline">Succeeds if and only if the current interpreter declares that it
supports undo functionality.
</p>
<p class="codeline">(transcript on)</p>
<p class="noteline">Enables the transcript feature. The interpreter takes care of asking
the player for a filename. If the operation succeeds, the query suceeds.
In case of an error, or if the operation was cancelled, the query
fails.
</p>
<p class="codeline">(transcript off)</p>
<p class="noteline">Disables the transcript feature. This predicate always succeeds.
</p>
<p class="codeline">(display memory statistics)</p>
<p class="noteline">Prints a line of information specific to the compiler backend, about
the peak memory usage in the heap, auxiliary heap, and long-term heap
areas. Currently, only the Z-machine backend does this. The size of
these areas can be adjusted by passing commandline options to the
compiler. During debugging and testing, you may wish to invoke this
predicate just before quitting, as it will tell you how close you are
to the limits.
