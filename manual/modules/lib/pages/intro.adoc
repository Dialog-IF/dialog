= Chapter 1: Getting started

The Dialog standard library is a framework for creating interactive stories in
English, coded in the Dialog programming language. The library provides the
basic implementation layer of an interactive game world—classification of
objects, standard actions, parser—and encodes the knowledge required to deal
with a multitude of special cases and gotchas.

At roughly 6000 lines of high-level code, the standard library is intended to be
substantial yet accessible. Both casual readers and determined explorers are
invited to dive into its inner workings, and see how everything fits together.

The world provided by the library is deliberately bland, serving as a neutral
backdrop for the stories that you will write. Dialog makes it easy to sketch the
outlines of an interactive story or old-school text adventure by merely defining
a couple of objects and extending the action-handling rules of the standard
library. For more ambitious works, you are encouraged to read and modify the
library code, adapting and reshaping the functionality, and wrapping it tightly
around the characteristics of your particular story.

== Architecture of the library

The chart below illustrates the overall architecture of the standard library,
and they ways in which it interfaces with story code. In the chart, blocks
generally only make queries to blocks that are directly below them; that's a
simplification, but it will do for now.

[#examples]
== Running the code examples

This part of the manual contains numerous examples, and readers are encouraged
to try them out. Copy the source code, put it in a text file, compile it
together with the standard library, and run the resulting story file using your
favourite Z-code interpreter. A quick reminder:

```
dialogc -t z8 story.dg stdlib.dg
```

where `story.dg` is your source code file, and `stdlib.dg` is the
standard library source code file. The order of the filenames is significant;
the story must appear before the library. In the above example, the output
filename will be `story.z8` (based on the output format and the name of the
first source code file), but this can be changed with the [.nobreak]#`-o`#
option.

You are encouraged to put the command in a makefile or batch file, to save
typing.

As you compile the example programs, you will get warnings about the lack of
story title, author, and IFID. Since the example mini-stories aren't meant to be
published, you may ignore these warnings. Before you release a work of IF
written in Dialog, please add the required link:beyondprg.html#metadata[story
metadata], including a freshly-generated IFID.

== A minimal story

The following is a perfectly functional, albeit simple, Dialog game:

[source]
----
(current player #player)
(#player is #in #room)
(room #room)
----

This game has two objects (`#player` and `#room`) in addition to a
handful of default objects provided by the standard library (such as
`#in`).

The first line says that when the game starts, the player character is
represented by the `#player` object.

The second line says that the `#player` object is initially located
inside another object, called `#room`.

The third line says that the object called `#room` is, in fact, a room:
This tells the library that the object can be entered, that it may have
connections to other rooms, and so on.

You should try this game now! There's not much of a plot, but you can poke
around at the two objects (they can be referred to as `ME` and
`HERE`), and try a few standard verbs such as `LOOK`
(`L`), `INVENTORY` (`I`), `JUMP`,
and `QUIT` (`Q`).
