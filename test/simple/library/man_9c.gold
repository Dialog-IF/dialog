“I see. Have you checked the battery?”

“The battery is brand new. Could it be something else, do you think?”

“And you're sure that there's gas in the tank?”

1. “Gas? Oh, gas! Yes, the man who sold me the car specifically said there was

“Next Thursday is fine.”

“All right then. You can leave the car out front.” Lisa returns to her work.

“Right. Goodbye for now, then!”
