“It doesn't start anymore, is the thing.”

“I see. Have you checked the battery?”

1. “How do I check the battery?”

“The battery is brand new. Could it be something else, do you think?”

“And you're sure that there's gas in the tank?”

1. “Gas? Oh, gas! Yes, the man who sold me the car specifically said there was
gas in the tank.”
