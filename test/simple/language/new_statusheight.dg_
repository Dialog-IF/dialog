%% This isn't very useful for automated testing, because dfrotz doesn't obey the status bar height directives
%% But 

(style class @statusbar)
	height: 2em;

(show number 0)
(show number $N)
	$N
	(line)
	($N minus 1 into $Nm1)
	(show number $Nm1)

(program entry point)
	*(repeat forever)
	> (get input [$Number])
	(if) ($Number = 99) (then) (par) (quit) (endif)
	(status bar @statusbar with height $Number) {
		(show number $Number)
	}
	(fail)
