Dear me. What happened?

Your vision is a bit blurry. Nothing hurts, at least. You can hear Watson
barking. It's bright, very bright, so it must be morning.

The last thing you remember was coming down the stairs. Did you stumble and
fall? Nigel would fuss and scold you over it, saying to be more careful at your
age. Things are coming into focus now...

Oh. Oh no.

Bottom of the stairs
This was once the front room of your house, before you sealed off the door here
and built the larger front room on the other side. Now it just serves as a
little hallway connecting the evening room to the south to the dining room to
the north. The stairs to the east lead up to the first floor.

Your body lies at the bottom of the stairs.

Ever-faithful Watson is crouched over it, whimpering faintly.

>> x watson

Watson is a wonderfully intelligent collie, and he's been oh so much help in
your past investigations. You've trained him quite well, if you do say so
yourself.

>> x me

Well, you feel fine. You don't look any different, at least to your eyes. You
seem to be wearing your favourite dress, the one with the pattern of little
flowers on it, which you certainly weren't when you fell. This sort of existence
will certainly take some getting used to.

"What's this then?" Inspector Hughes strides into the hall, flanked by a little
gaggle of lower-ranking constabulary. "Bloody hell...so this is how the old bird
finally went. Never thought she'd meet her end in an accident, not after a
career of dealing with crime."

> Bottom of the stairs                            [                              ]

>> north

You focus your thoughts, and try to go north, and yet nothing seems to happen...

Watson looks up at you and blinks in surprise.

Constable Phillips sets to work marking out where you've fallen, while his
colleague Davis examines your body. Hughes strokes his moustache as he surveys
the stairs. "Looks like an open-and-shut case. Look at 'er nightdress. Must have
got up in the morning and took a tumble down the stairs."

The morning? No...no, that's not right. It was just past midnight...you were
trying to find your way downstairs with a torch...you had to get to...the
telephone, wasn't it? Everything is so fuzzy...

>> zxcvbn

Your mind is still a bit fuzzy, and you can't quite make sense of that idea at
the moment.

The Inspector turns to go. "For all we know, that bloody dog of hers might have
given her a push." Watson?! He would never! "I'll get the coroner in. Davis, get
a report written up and sent to Biddlecombe by the end of today. Looks like it
really was an accident in the end."

No! That's it! You woke up, you recognised those symptoms...the choking feeling,
the burning in your stomach—how could you ever mistake the signs of white
arsenic poisoning?

You tried to get to the telephone, but the electricity had gone out again. You
were making your way down with a torch...that's it, the torch would prove it was
the middle of the night, not the morning, now wouldn't it? Now where in heaven's
name did it get off to?

> Bottom of the stairs                            [                              ]

>> watson, north

Watson perks up, about to go north—until one of the constables grabs him by the
collar.

"For once, a nice, open-and-shut case."

Oh, that small-minded Inspector! Even a perfunctory investigation should find
signs of poison! But he's so sure it was your ordinary morning routine that he
won't even consider the possibility.

> >> hughes, wait

Inspector Hughes shows not the slightest hint of recognition. You might as well
be talking to a brick wall.

Hughes strides out while Davis finishes up her measurements. "And get that
bloody creature out of our way!" Suddenly Phillips has grabbed Watson by the
collar and is dragging him off to the sitting room.

Watson's eyes are fixed on you as he's pulled away, whimpering and scrabbling at
the carpet. Even if the police won't listen, Watson will! So you imagine
yourself following him, and the world around you changes... Miss Gosling's Last Case

Sitting room
The big south-facing windows in this room give it the best light in the house,
so you always take your breakfast and tea here. Normally it would be half-filled
with your potted plants, but you took those out for Alfred to look at last week,
and you haven't had a moment to move them back in yet. The room continues west
from here, while the hall leads north over a small step to the rest of the
house.

Watson's lead has been looped over the post of your favourite chair, keeping him
from interfering in the crime scene.

A rubber ball lies on the floor nearby.

Your ill-conceived binocular stand is fixed in front of the bay window.

In this state, you can't do much yourself. The best you can do is LOOK around,
EXAMINE something, or RECALL a person.

>> x ball

It's a hard rubber ball, the sort Watson loves to chew on. You've put a treat
inside it for him to try to work out, a little puzzle for him to solve.

Since you EXAMINE so many things in your investigations, you can abbreviate it
to X.

For anything more elaborate than that, you'll have to rely on Watson. For
example, tell him to TAKE THE BALL.

>> watson, take ball

(You don't have to mention Watson's name explicitly; he's the only one around
who can hear your commands, after all.)
Watson opens his mouth and carefully scoops up the rubber ball.

If you say INVENTORY, Watson will show you what he's holding.

Exits: north west

>> inventory

Watson holds up the rubber ball proudly for your inspection. His collar keeps
him from moving more than four feet from the chair.

"Take inventory" is one of the stranger tricks you've taught him, but it just
feels more professional than "show me".

He can only hold one thing in his mouth at a time, but he's very good at
manipulating objects in various ways.

You've taught Watson plenty of ways to manipulate objects: he can TAKE and DROP
them, but also PUSH, PULL, OPEN, CLOSE, CLIMB, and SEARCH them, among others.

> >> push ball

Watson bats at the toy, but the treat doesn't come out. It'll take more force
than that.

The text will usually imply what actions will be useful for certain objects. But
if you're not sure what to do with something, HELP [OBJECT] (e.g. HELP BALL)
will give suggestions.

A few special commands are always available:
    UNDO to take back your last action
    SAVE and RESTORE to save your game
    THINK to list the puzzles you're facing and the ones you've already solved
    HELP for a full list of commands
    ABOUT for information about the game

Watson doesn't need telling twice. Soon there's nothing left of the treat.

In what direction?

> >> w

Watson tugs on his lead, and the chair on its wheels glides smoothly along
behind. You drift after him to the west.

The rubber ball proves too small to foul the wheels, and is left behind.

Evening room
Really this is just another part of the sitting room, but when the house was
modernised and electrified, the west half was lit up and the east half left to
its natural light. So you've taken to calling this the evening room, a
comfortable place to sit after supper when you don't want to brave the stairs to
the library. The stairs themselves end to the north, up a small step.

A layer of police tape blocks off the door to the north.

Watson's lead has been looped over the post of your favourite chair, keeping him
from interfering in the crime scene.

Your collection of mystery novels is kept on a high shelf, out of Watson's

reach.

Some people do think it's odd that you've taught him compass directions, but he
would always get so confused between your right and his right. This just works
out better all around.

Exits: (north) east

>> x shelf

You made sure to put the bookshelf high enough that Watson couldn't reach it.
It's not that he'd chew on the books; no, he's far too well-trained for that.
But he has a tendency to knock things over in his excitement. Now your paperback
murder mysteries are both safe, and within easy reach. Easy reach for a human,
at least.

>> climb shelf

Watson stretches his body, trying to reach the bookshelf, then settles back with
a sad whimper.
Messages like this, telling you why you can't do something, often indicate
puzzles to be solved. In this case, the shelf is too high for Watson to reach;
perhaps he could reach it if he were higher up?

>> books

Most of your books are kept in the library upstairs, of course, but you've
turned this room into such a lovely place to read in the evenings, and the
stairs have been getting harder to manage every year. So you've started a
collection of paperback mystery novels down here, for when you're in the mood
for some light reading.

The books tumble around and under the chair's wheels in a messy pile.

> >> east

(pulling your comfortable chair along)
Watson lopes back east, pulling the chair behind him...until it catches, pulling
him up short. One of your books is trapped under the wheel! But he keeps
pulling, and between the lead on the post pulling it forward and the caught
wheel holding it back, it topples forward with a grand, stately crash.

With the top posts now resting on the floor, the lead is within Watson's reach,
and with a look of doggy triumph he pulls it free!

Watson is free, and it's time to solve this case! First, you'll have to get back
to the scene of the crime: if you can find evidence that this happened at
midnight instead of in the morning, maybe that will convince the constables that
it wasn't an accident.

Good luck, detective!

Watson chomps down on the police tape, taking a big chunk out of the middle and

Watson saunters through the shredded police tape, and you drift along behind.

Bottom of the stairs
This was once the front room of your house, before you sealed off the door here
and built the larger front room on the other side. Now it just serves as a
little hallway connecting the evening room to the south to the dining room to
the north. The stairs to the east lead up to the first floor.

A layer of police tape blocks off the door to the north.

Your body lies at the bottom of the stairs.

A big grate is set into the floor under the stairs.

Your telephone hangs in its niche on the north wall.

Various old newspapers are stacked in the corner.

>> phone

It is, even you have to admit, rather old-fashioned to have a telephone niche.
Most people keep their telephones on tables now. But you always liked how it
looked, so when you upgraded to a modern telephone, you kept it in the old
niche. Things do occasionally roll under it and get lost.

Davis makes her way from the dining room to the bottom of the stairs (where you
are).

> >> z

Watson tries as hard as he can to demonstrate patience.

Davis scans the room for anything amiss. Nothing, nothing...then Watson barks
again, sniffing at the stack of newspapers, and she takes a closer look.

"What's this? A torch?" She fishes it out, turning it over in her hand. "Still
on, cells still good. Why would she 'ave had a torch at nine in the morning on a
bright sunny day?"

You watch as it clicks in her head, and she hurries to the telephone.
"Something's wrong here. I better ring the Inspector and tell the boys at the
lab..." "...results back from Fletcher at the lab. The Marsh test was positive. Arsenic
poisoning, without a doubt." Well, obviously; you could have told them yourself
if you'd made it to the phone in time. The constables are gathered around your
dining room table now, listening as Davis summarises the situation. "Given her
experience with poisons, it's unlikely this was an accident. I think we need to
seriously consider the possibility of foul play."

Hughes is tugging at his moustache. "Hmph. Quite. Good catch with the torch;
would have been a disgrace for the department if we'd missed that. Now that we
know, we're not going to leave a single stone unturned. Do we have a motive?
Inheritance?"

"It seems likely. We found a will in her library. Various bequests to charities
and organizations, and four specific people who will benefit quite, well,
substantially."

"Opportunity?"

Phillips clears his throat. "I've been going through her diary." Inevitable, you

suppose—you would have done the same—but rude nonetheless. "Fletcher says death
occurred between midnight and 2:00 AM, and the poison must have been
consumed—orally—somewhere between four and twelve hours before that. That gives
all four of them the opportunity."

Hughes furrows his bushy eyebrows. "Four to twelve hours? She had lunch with me
at the King's Arms yesterday. I'll be asking some questions around there."

Davis lays her papers out on the table. "Each of those people had access to her
food or drink within that timespan." ("Or medication," Phillips adds.)

"First is her nephew Nigel. That afternoon, he was helping her go through some
records in her attic. It seems she's got a sort of a laboratory up there, and he
could have tampered with her chemicals." Nigel? He'd never have the stomach for
it.

"Second is Mrs Charlotte Peabody. Gosling had dinner with her that night, and
specifically mentioned a one-peck bundle of carrots Peabody brought from the
farmer's market. Gosling ate plenty, but Peabody didn't touch them." Well, of
course. Lottie can't stand the smell of carrots, that's why she gave them to you
in the first place. "We need to find and test the remaining carrots."

"Third is Alfred Tucker, her gardener." Preposterous. "After supper she drank an
herbal tea made with green roses. They must have been gathered from one of her
gardens. Arsenious oxide is sometimes used as a weed killer. If Tucker applied
some to the flower petals, she'd be poisoned some time later, when she finally
made tea from those ones." Not at all his style. "We need to find the bush she
took these from and test if it's absorbed anything."

"Finally, there's her aide, Emily Morris." Emily? The girl never had a malicious
thought in her life. "She arranged for all her medications, and could easily
have tampered with them."

Hughes stands, smoothing out his now-frazzled moustache again. "Right then!
Biddlecombe will be setting up in the library to handle communications.
Phillips, I want you to find and test those medications first thing. They have
to be somewhere in her room. Davis, track down the details on those suspects.
We'll be asking them a few questions. We'll have this case cracked right open
before it hits the papers!" He glares down at Watson, who's snuffling curiously
at his hand. "And get that bloody beast out of here!"

Your kitchen isn't spacious by any stretch of the imagination, but you've always

This is the proper place to share a meal with someone, with plenty of windows, a

You would never call yourself vain, or overly proud of your success. But you
could never resist showing off a few of your best and most notable
accomplishments. Right now, you have the evidence from the Disgybl Gwydion case
laid out here, with some of your other cases displayed in the reception room and
the upstairs balcony.

Davis takes a bite of her sandwich.

> >> evidence

You normally wouldn't include an unsolved case here...much less one where the
constables never proved there was even a crime committed at all. But it did get
a lot of press, and it did revolve around your house—and you kicked off the
whole thing when you found this notebook during renovations. It seems one of the
previous occupants called himself "Disgybl Gwydion", claimed to be heir to the
ancient Druids, performing strange rituals in the flower gardens and seeking
eternal life.

...ancestral spirits / lares and penates, bound through belief, worship? / no,
alchemical process-congelation of the soul! See Petrus Catadesmicus, Liber
Animarum / but held to the anchor, how to move and act? / Kizzuwatnan ritual,
the kuwac hapanza - Father's Encyclopedia vol K p 197 - replaces the nails or
spikes! / must be in the right place... Perhaps the translation the constables
gave you is faulty, or perhaps (as you've long suspected) it's just nonsense.
But it's a reminder that sometimes there just aren't answers to be found
anywhere in this world.

You've always seen promise in Davis, from when she was just starting out as a
bright-eyed new recruit. But she's got a certain earnestness you've never quite
been able to sway her from. Now she spends most of her time taking every menial
task that's pushed onto her, thinking straightforward honesty is the best path
to promotion. Eventually, something is bound to shake her enough to take some
initiative of her own...or at least, that was always your hope.

the right motivation—but he would do it in anger, with his own hands. Cold,
impersonal poison is not his style.

Unfortunately, he isn't anywhere near your house at the moment.

Lawn
It's really not big enough to be called the grounds, but you've always been
proud of your lawn and gardens, encircling the house on all sides. The most
important one right now is your tea garden, down to the south; the veranda is
back to the north.

Today's newspaper lies in front of the porch steps.

Watson saunters north, and you drift along behind.

Veranda
A little refuge from the weather, for when you want the fresh outdoor air
without all the sun and the rain, between the front door to the north and the
lawn to the south.

(attempting to go north)
Watson saunters through the front door, and you drift along behind.

Reception room
You designed this room specifically for uninvited guests. Back when the front

door was at the west end of the house, they'd have to wait awkwardly outside
until you had the sitting room or dining room in order. Now, there's a place to
sit and take tea with them at a moment's notice—and admire the framed case
reports on the wall—and that can make witnesses ever so much more willing to
open up. What used to be the back door of the house leads northwest to the
kitchen, and the new front door leads out to the south.

Today's mail is scattered across the floor.

is back to the south.

The dumbwaiter shaft is set into the north wall.

Constable Davis herself sits in one of your chairs, hard at work. Her paperwork

"Hm? What's this?" The constable looks down at the torn branch in Watson's
mouth.

"Wait—is this—?" She takes it carefully, avoiding the thorns and the dog
slobber. "The green roses! This must be from the same bush as the tea she drank
last night! The boffins at the lab will need a look at this."

Watson sits back and wags his tail happily as Davis hurries off. It will take
some time for the laboratory tests to come back, but you already know what
they'll say: that the roses weren't poisoned, and Alfred is innocent.

Your score has gone up by one point.

Lottie left it when she was over for dinner, filled with photos of her trip out

and she loved talking about all the intricate details of what they were doing.
Fiddly details have always been her favourite thing, and she kept pushing you to
keep working on those constabulary records that weren't lining up—she just had a
feeling it was a sign of something worse.

brought them over for you and Watson to enjoy. They should be good, even if
they're mildly soggy now.

As you speak the word, you feel a strange sensation pulling you west... Watson
splashes away to the west, and you try your best to follow...until suddenly a
hint of light is visible in the darkness.

It's pitch dark, and you can barely see a thing. You can make out light to the

Watson noses his way out the root cellar door, and you drift along behind.

In the torchlight, your fears are confirmed: Watson is standing in at least
three inches of water. Oh, what a mess...

The door to the root cellar is now visible to the south.

The dumbwaiter hangs well above Watson's head, with a tape recorder and your
torch in it.

The door to the root cellar swings closed again.

Watson saunters southwest, and you drift along behind.

Landing
The stairs turn around sharply here at a little wooden landing, just a foot or
so above the ground. The pump here is supposed to keep your cellar from
flooding, but with the electricity out, you now know it's thoroughly failed at
that. The cellar proper is down to the northeast, in near-total darkness without
the light from the hall windows, or you can go back up to the east.

That photo album Lottie brought has been set in the corner for when she comes
back.

(attempting to go east)
Watson saunters up the cellar stairs, and you drift along behind.

Hall
This narrow hallway is right at the centre of the house, linking the sitting

room to the south to the kitchen to the north. To the west, dark stairs lead
down to the cellar, and to the east used to be a closet until you had it turned
into a tiny little lavatory.

(attempting to go north)
Watson saunters north, and you drift along behind.

Kitchen
Your kitchen isn't spacious by any stretch of the imagination, but you've always
found it cozy rather than cramped. A big door leads west to the dining room, and
a smaller one leads southeast to your new reception room; the rest of the house
is back to the south.

The dumbwaiter shaft is set into the north wall.

The stove is tucked away to one side.

Davis looks down at Watson, and winces at the sight of water being dripped all
over your rug. (Well, it can't be helped.) It takes her a moment more to realise
what exactly it's dripping from.

"The carrots!" Watson lets go obligingly as she heaves the bundle up onto the
table, trying to keep it from soaking her paperwork. "Don't know how you knew we
needed these, but I'll get them to the lab right away. Thanks, boy."

Watson sits back with a proud smile as Davis makes the arrangements, though he
seems a bit sad not to be given a carrot himself for his efforts. The lab tests
will take a while, but you're confident they'll come back clean. Lottie is
innocent.

This was once the front room of your house, before you sealed off the door here

gentle thump on the balcony.

The hallway ends with a narrow balcony, connecting your bedroom to the south
with everything else to the north. The railing to the east protects you from a
dizzying drop to the bottom of the stairs. Evidence from another of your past

Watson leaps up onto the victrola.

> >> jump on organ

Watson focuses intently on the organ, gauging the distance for a moment. Then
with a mighty leap, he launches himself across the gap!

Attic, east (on the organ)
There are only two real rooms in the attic: the laboratory, in the center, and
everything else, forming a huge ring around it. This is the east side of that
ring, packed to the gills with the clutter of a life well lived.

Outside your little circle of torchlight, who knows what might be hidden in the
darkness?

The door to your laboratory stands to the west.

A faint hint of light outlines the heavy shutters blocking the window.

A reed organ is positioned against the inner wall.

Your torch is on the organ.

Watson peers toward the grandfather clock in the south side of the attic, then
whimpers nervously. He's a great leaper and could probably cross the distance,
but he can't see it well enough in the dark to be sure of his landing.

it sailing to the south side of the attic.

sad whimper.

From his perch atop the clock, Watson stretches up and catches the chain in his
mouth. With a sharp tug the shutters all around the attic snap open, and the
afternoon sunlight streams in.

You kneel down and guide Watson's nose to the right place, and he starts
scratching at the carpet with furious intensity. He doesn't get the opportunity
to dig very often, and he's determined to make the most of this moment. Soon a
corner tears free, revealing the vent hidden underneath.

You can't see Watson moving, but as he scrabbles through the vents, you find
yourself pulled along to the north.

Laboratory (in the floor vents)
At the very center of the attic is the laboratory, where you spend your spare
time tinkering with chemicals. Nigel jokes that you're a fairy-tale witch
updated to the twentieth century, but it's been plenty of help with cases in the
past—and besides, everyone needs a hobby.

The door leads out to the east, thankfully easier to open from this side.

In the afternoon sunlight, you can just barely trace the outline of the vents
under the carpet.

Your box of poisons lies in the midst of the equipment, clearly labelled for
safety.

Watson clambers down the attic stairs, and you drift along behind.

Upstairs hall
The hall runs alongside the staircase here before bending sharply at the end,
with a little balcony to the south overlooking the first floor. The top of the
stairs is back to the southeast, and the guest room will be to the north—once
it's been properly repainted and made livable, at least.

The trapdoor to the attic is open, the collapsible steps leading up to the
south.

Watson saunters southeast, and you drift along behind.

Top of the stairs
The afternoon light coming through the big windows makes the first floor look so
cheerful and pleasant, and not at all like the place someone fell to her death
just last night. It's better that way; you've never wanted this house to look
dreary by any stretch of the imagination. Identical doors lead north and south
to your library and master suite, respectively; the hallway continues to the
northwest, and the stairs lead back down to the west.

From the sound of it, Phillips is hard at work in the suite to the south.

Watson saunters down the stairs, and you drift along behind.

Bottom of the stairs
This was once the front room of your house, before you sealed off the door here
and built the larger front room on the other side. Now it just serves as a
little hallway connecting the evening room to the south to the dining room to
the north. The stairs to the east lead up to the first floor.

A mattress lies at the bottom of the stairs, where you fell.

A big grate is set into the floor under the stairs.

Your telephone hangs in its niche on the north wall.

Various old newspapers are stacked in the corner.

"What's this now?" Watson pushes the box insistently into Davis's hands, and she
has to turn it around to read it. "Poisons? Now where on earth did you get
this?" She extricates it carefully from his mouth, and opens it to see the
assortment of carefully-labelled vials inside. "This would be from her
laboratory, then? The nephew could have tampered with them—you," she looks
severely at Watson, "need to be more careful! It could have poisoned you too."

She seals the box again. "The fingerprints will tell us one way or another." But
you already know the answer; Nigel isn't the sort to do a thing like that. The
tests will prove him innocent.

Reception room
You designed this room specifically for uninvited guests. Back when the front
door was at the west end of the house, they'd have to wait awkwardly outside
until you had the sitting room or dining room in order. Now, there's a place to
sit and take tea with them at a moment's notice—and admire the framed case
reports on the wall—and that can make witnesses ever so much more willing to
open up. What used to be the back door of the house leads northwest to the
kitchen, and the new front door leads out to the south.

Today's mail is scattered across the floor.

"Fastidious" is perhaps the best word to describe the young constable, so
insistent on doing everything by the book. You always appreciate his
thoroughness in searching for clues, now that you're in no state to be bending
down and dusting for fingerprints under automobiles and such, but he'll never be
promoted if he can't learn to put the pieces together himself. When he's set
himself to a task, nothing short of an absolute emergency will sway him from his
course.

Currently, he should be in the kitchen.

In the top of the stairs, the smoke alarm continues to shriek. Phillips sprints
out to the veranda, finally pausing to see if the alarm continues.

What could the constables have been searching for in here? You keep your
medicines locked in the bathroom, and the keys on the nightstand in your
bedroom.

The alarm falls silent, and Watson can finally relax again. Phillips heads off
to investigate this false alarm.

Davis makes her way from the kitchen to the dining room.

Bedroom
As your age advances, the little luxuries of your bedroom have suffered for it.
Even with Emily's help, you've had to recognise the difficulties in day-to-day
life, and the room is now designed around being cared for rather than
comfortable. The suite opens out to the east, and a door to the north leads out
to the rest of the house.

Your bed stands in equal disarray. You'd given no thought to tidying it up.

The nightstand is placed next to the head of the bed, entirely devoid of keys.

Not quite as soft as you would like it, sadly; at your age, getting into and out
of it easily has become more of a priority. Now the mattress is too firm and
there's an unattractively large gap underneath.

You got this from the constables, at Emily's insistence; she maintains that
someone you exposed will eventually want revenge, and having a weapon on hand
will make them think twice about coming into your house. She means well, but
she's never quite understood how these things actually happen—you have no idea
how to use something like this effectively, and a person bent on murder won't be
dissuaded by it.

You used to feel a bit ashamed to admit it, but a companion really is a
necessity at your age. She checks in on you periodically, arranges your
medicines, and handles any problems before they come up; not the brightest girl,
perhaps, but a very good heart. She'd be horrified by the very idea of murder,
and probably end up in tears for even thinking about it.

Unfortunately, she isn't anywhere near your house at the moment.

Bathroom
Watson is far more excited about this room than you are—it's normally off-limits

leads back southwest.

You keep your medicines in a mirrored cabinet to one side.

More a functional piece of furniture than a beautiful one, it works as both a

You only wish it could be set into the wall, instead of free-standing. The
baseboards keep it from standing quite flush, leaving an inch or so of space
behind it, and you can see a glint of something caught back there.

A mattress lies at the bottom of the stairs, where you fell. On the mattress is

In the afternoon sunlight, you can just barely trace the outline of the vents

Off to the northeast, you can clearly see a victrola. Watson might be able to

Off to the southeast, you can clearly see a grandfather clock. Watson might be

bedroom upside down for?" She actually laughs as he drops it in her hand. "How
did you find these before he did? Such a good dog!" She opens the box and counts
out the remaining pills. "I'll get these down to the lab, and they'll know if
anyone tampered with them." They didn't, of course; Emily is the only one to
have the opportunity, and she's too diligent to make that mistake. But this will
confirm it, and rule her out once and for all.

'ave happened?"

She looks down at Watson, as if he's going to have an answer for her, then
stands. "I'm getting the other two. We need a new direction." Biddlecombe is
promptly summoned down from the library, and Phillips from wherever he's gotten
off to; soon all three of them are huddled together around the table, comparing

Library
Nobody else ever likes this room. They say the carpets and the drapes clash
horribly with the bookshelves, and they can never find what they're looking for.
But that really doesn't matter; it's a place for you to work, study, and read,
and to your eyes, the colours are perfectly fine. The only door leads back to
the south.

The dumbwaiter used to run through here, but you covered over the shaft when you
turned the room into a library. There was just too much risk of something
spilling out.

It's very simple, if you know the trick. You direct Watson to pull one
particular book off the shelf, then a second, then a third—and as the last one
falls, the cases swing silently outward to reveal your desk in the niche behind
them. It's still covered with those ledgers and files from last week; you kept
meaning to get back to that investigation...

It is, perhaps, not truly necessary to hide your desk behind a bookcase. But
when you came across a mechanism like this in one of your investigations, you
simply couldn't resist. Now your workspace is tucked away behind the shelves
when it's not being used.

> >> ledgers

Dozens of records and ledgers from the constabulary are laid out here, carefully
arranged so you can compare them side by side. This isn't the sort of business
you normally do, but the Inspector had remarked a few weeks back that their
auditors couldn't make heads nor tails of the discrepancies, and you thought it
might be linked to something deeper. Really, you started to regret it by the
third page, which is why you left it sitting here for a week and a half.

But being murdered does tend to lend some urgency to things. You settle yourself
over the desk and direct Watson how to push the papers around, letting you look
for the patterns you need. It's tedious work, but you don't seem to grow tired
the way you used to.

None of these discrepancies make sense. Their bookkeeping isn't just atrocious:
it seems designed to be as confusing as possible. But the only person with the

Watson lets out a loud bark that echoes through the house, then looks up at you
for approval, tail wagging happily.

Off in the dining room, Davis steadfastly ignores the sound. She's investigating
a murder now, and can't be distracted by barking dogs!

Constable Davis herself sits in one of your chairs, hard at work. Her paperwork
covers the table.

Davis is hurriedly gathering up the most important files. "I have to get this
all in order—the Inspector is on his way!" She spares Watson a quick, apologetic
glance, then hurries out of the room.

So Hughes is coming. He'll never let the other constables see the evidence now.
But this isn't time to panic; it's time to act.

Nobody else ever likes this room. They say the carpets and the drapes clash

But that really doesn't matter; it's a place for you to work, study, and read,
and to your eyes, the colours are perfectly fine. The only door leads back to

Your desk is now visible behind the secret door, covered with various ledgers
and files.

The dumbwaiter used to run through here, but you covered over the shaft when you
turned the room into a library. There was just too much risk of something

Barely a moment later the door slams open and Inspector Hughes strides in, his

find a single bloody thing. It's time to take care of this myself."

>> hughes

You have a long history with Basil Hughes, and it's in no small part thanks to
your investigations that he's risen through the ranks from Constable to
Inspector. He has his eye on Chief Inspector now, but really, well...the man is
far too close-minded, far too quick to jump to the obvious conclusion. Large and
stout, with an immaculate uniform and an impressive moustache, he tries to look
every bit the image of the modern constabulary.

"Now, what have we here?" Hughes sets his briefcase on the desk.

>> bite hughes

You've trained Watson well not to get aggressive with people, but he's smart
enough to understand the anger behind that command—he leaps at the Inspector
with a growl, teeth bared to bite! Hughes does his best to fend him off, but his
Inverness coat now has some dramatic new tears.

"Shoo! Get out of here! Go!" With a hiss of displeasure, Hughes turns back to
the desk.

Watson needs very little encouragement to throw himself upon the Inspector,
lavishing him with distinctly unwanted canine affection. Hughes tries his

Inspector fights free his face and hands are thoroughly wet.

"Shoo! Get out of here! Go!" With a hiss of displeasure, Hughes turns back to
the desk.

The moment Hughes's back is turned, Watson reaches up and gives his briefcase a
mighty shove, sending it to the floor. The Inspector whirls around a moment too
late to stop him from snatching it up, and he's off on a merry chase!

Watson manages to evade the constable for a good while before Hughes eventually
manages to snag his case back, puffing and panting for breath.

"Shoo! Get out of here! Go!" With a hiss of displeasure, Hughes turns back to

Watson's tail wags for a moment, and the Inspector has only a moment of warning
before he leaps up onto the desk, papers flying everywhere! Hughes shouts
something incoherent and tries to push him aside, his work now scattered all
over the room.

"Wretched mutt! You're as bad as she was!" Hughes visibly composes himself for a
moment before going back to his task.

> >> bark

Positioning himself right behind Hughes's work, Watson waits for the perfect
moment to let out a thunderous bark. The Inspector jumps, clenching his hand so
hard on a pen that it snaps in half.

"ENOUGH!" Hughes whirls on Watson, rage burning on his face. "You confounded
beast! I had it all arranged! There was no evidence to be found! We'd file it as
an accident and close the case, or send Davis and Phillips on a snipe hunt until
the case went cold! But you, you had to get in my way at every single turn!"

He snatches up a stack of papers and starts to shred them between his hands.
"But it's not enough. This was the last evidence of the motive, and without it,
they'll never even begin to investigate. This house is going up for auction, and
you're going to the pound!"

He aims a petty kick at Watson as he flings the door open and storms out of the
room.

Your score has gone up by one point.

taps 'play'.

There's a minute of muffled silence, the sounds of someone rifling around in the
library, and Davis frowns. But then Hughes's voice comes through loud and clear.
I had it all arranged! There was no evidence to be found! We'd file it as an
accident and close the case, or send Davis and Phillips on a snipe hunt until

The recorder falls from the constable's hand with a crash. "Inspector Hughes?
He—why—"

Watson sits back on his haunches, panting happily as Davis grabs the recorder
and sprints off. Finally taking her own initiative, for once in her life; you
wish you could tell her you were proud. She's the sort who will dot all the i's
and cross all the t's, and with a confession like that, Hughes has no way to
wiggle out of it.

found it cozy rather than cramped. A big door leads west to the dining room, and
a smaller one leads southeast to your new reception room; the rest of the house
is back to the south.

The dumbwaiter is here, with a broken medicine chest in it.

The stove is tucked away to one side.

(attempting to go southeast)
Watson saunters southeast, and you drift along behind.

Reception room

Reception room                                  [==============================]
Exits: (south) northwest

You designed this room specifically for uninvited guests. Back when the front
door was at the west end of the house, they'd have to wait awkwardly outside
until you had the sitting room or dining room in order. Now, there's a place to
sit and take tea with them at a moment's notice—and admire the framed case
reports on the wall—and that can make witnesses ever so much more willing to
open up. What used to be the back door of the house leads northwest to the
kitchen, and the new front door leads out to the south.

>> open door

Watson noses the front door open.

> >> find calendulas

Watson leaps up and sprints off in hot pursuit of the calendula, heading for the
northeast bed.

(attempting to go south)
Watson saunters out the front door, and you drift along behind.

Veranda
A little refuge from the weather, for when you want the fresh outdoor air
without all the sun and the rain, between the front door to the north and the
lawn to the south.

(attempting to go south)
Watson saunters south, and you drift along behind.

Lawn
It's really not big enough to be called the grounds, but you've always been
proud of your lawn and gardens, encircling the house on all sides. The most
important one right now is your tea garden, down to the south; the veranda is

back to the north.

Today's newspaper lies in front of the porch steps.

(attempting to go south)
Watson saunters south, and you drift along behind.

Tea garden, centre
Your tea garden is nestled deep in the foundation of the old ruins, the stone
walls rising up on every side to give the plants just the perfect amount of
sunlight and shade. Here at the centre is where you placed that lovely fountain,
and a sturdy chair, to sit in while you contemplate your options.

The garden beds themselves are arranged in a ring around you, and the path north
leads back to the lawn. You have a lovely view of the whole thing from your
sitting room.

On the garden chair are a pair of gardening gloves.

(attempting to go northeast)
Watson saunters northeast, and you drift along behind.

Tea garden, northeast                           [==============================]
Exits: west southwest southeast

Tea garden, northeast
The garden bed under the old walls is just as neat and tidy as ever, as it
should be. The calendula is flourishing, ready for your next cup of tea.

>> dig calendulas

Normally, Watson would be too well-trained to obey an order like that. He knows
perfectly well that your garden is not for digging. And yet...he knows that
there's something odd here, different from all the rest.

He throws himself into the work with great enthusiasm, uprooting your poor
calendulas left and right, until with an awful lurch the garden bed collapses in
on itself and sinks down into something underneath! This must be where the old
cistern was, long ago; you'd been told the house had one when you bought it, but
you never saw it yourself.

Exits: up down

>> down

Watson clambers down the messy tunnel, and you drift along behind.

Old cistern
The old cistern isn't especially large, and if you still had a body, you
wouldn't be able to stand up without hitting your head. Lichen covers the old
stones, and in one corner they've crumbled away entirely into some sort of
cavern beneath.

A messy hole leads back to the garden above.

Your score has gone up by one point.

Watson clambers down, and you drift along behind.

Ancient chamber
This place cannot exist. It simply can't. You can't even stop your cellar from
flooding, for goodness' sake; how could a chamber like this possibly stay dry?
For that matter, how can you even see Watson three feet in front of you, with no
light coming down from the surface?

And yet somehow it does, fifteen feet wide and round like a dome, the ancient
walls crumbling with lichen. A roughly-hewn slab of stone stands right in the
middle.

Exits: up

>> get on altar

Watson leaps up onto the stone slab.

>> bite mail

You're not quite sure what to expect when Watson sinks his teeth into the mail.
Some part of you remains convinced that it's all nonsense. Another part is being
steadily forced to accept the existence of ghosts, which you have steadfastly
refused to accept as an explanation for murder for the past fifty-some years.

Whatever you expected, it wasn't this.

It feels like your whole spirit is being forced through a funnel just over your
heart, drawn out and twisted into a cord, needled through the mail like a thread
through cloth. You become your name, and your name becomes you, and Watson—

Nothing has changed, and at the same time, everything has changed. You feel no
more solid than before. But in some strange way, you're more real. More certain
that your story isn't quite yet reaching its end.

Your score has gone up by one point.

Watson sets the mail carefully on the stone slab.

> >> find davis

Watson leaps up and sprints off in hot pursuit of Constable Davis, heading for
the dining room.

The garden bed under the old walls is just as neat and tidy as ever, as it

A large sinkhole in the middle of the garden bed thoroughly disrupts the
aesthetic.

Watson saunters southwest, and you drift along behind.

Dining room
This is the proper place to share a meal with someone, with plenty of windows, a
big table, and a lovely chandelier. Display cabinets along the walls show off
some of your favourite curiosities from your long career; doors lead east to the
kitchen and south to the rest of the house.

You see a tape recorder here.

Constable Davis herself sits in one of your chairs, hard at work. Her paperwork
covers the table.

Davis pulls out another page, cross-checking it against the last.

>> get recorder

Watson opens his mouth and carefully scoops up the tape recorder.

Davis looks for her biscuit, realises she's run out, and sighs.

> >> give recorder to davis

"Hm? What's'at?" Davis sounds exhausted as she looks down at the recorder. "Ah,
you found this for us. Thanks, dog." She checks the tape, then rewinds it and
taps 'play'.

There's a minute of muffled silence, the sounds of someone rifling around in the
library, and Davis frowns. But then Hughes's voice comes through loud and clear.
I had it all arranged! There was no evidence to be found! We'd file it as an
accident and close the case, or send Davis and Phillips on a snipe hunt until
the case went cold!

The recorder falls from the constable's hand with a crash. "Inspector Hughes?
He—why—"

Watson sits back on his haunches, panting happily as Davis grabs the recorder
and sprints off. Finally taking her own initiative, for once in her life; you
wish you could tell her you were proud. She's the sort who will dot all the i's
and cross all the t's, and with a confession like that, Hughes has no way to
wiggle out of it.

The End                                         [==============================]

The front door slams, and you're left alone in the silence. Davis will get the
credit, of course, but you don't mind that; you've had plenty of glory in your
time. Someone else can get the accolades for solving your own murder.

The real question is—what comes next for you? That odd ritual seems to have
bound your soul to Watson, and that binding shows no signs of fading. You look
down at Watson, who's sitting back on his haunches, panting happily. You might
not know what the next chapter in your story will bring, but it certainly won't
be the last.

Congratulations on solving the metapuzzle and reaching the true ending! This
puzzle was run as a competition during IFComp 2024, with the prize won by S. V.
Linwood.
