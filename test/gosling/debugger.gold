Dear me. What happened?

Your vision is a bit blurry. Nothing hurts, at least. You can hear Watson
barking. It’s bright, very bright, so it must be morning.

The last thing you remember was coming down the stairs. Did you stumble and
fall? Nigel would fuss and scold you over it, saying to be more careful at your
age. Things are coming into focus now...

Oh. Oh no.

Bottom of the stairs
This was once the front room of your house, before you sealed off the door here
and built the larger front room on the other side. Now it just serves as a
little hallway connecting the evening room to the south to the dining room to
the north. The stairs to the east lead up to the first floor.

Your body lies at the bottom of the stairs.

Ever-faithful Watson is crouched over it, whimpering faintly.

<look at my body>
<look at Watson>
<stand up>
<go upstairs>
<go to the sitting room>
> * *** Opening scene ***
> x watson
Watson is a wonderfully intelligent collie, and he’s been oh so much help in
your past investigations. You’ve trained him quite well, if you do say so
yourself.

<look at my body>
<stand up>
<go upstairs>
<go to the sitting room>
<tell Watson to come here>
> x me
Well, you feel fine. You don’t look any different, at least to your eyes. You
seem to be wearing your favourite dress, the one with the pattern of little
flowers on it, which you certainly weren’t when you fell. This sort of
existence will certainly take some getting used to.

“What’s this then?” Inspector Hughes strides into the hall, flanked by a little
gaggle of lower-ranking constabulary. “Bloody hell...so this is how the old
bird finally went. Never thought she’d meet her end in an accident, not after a
career of dealing with crime.”

<look at my body>
<look at the constables>
<stand up>
<go upstairs>
<go to the sitting room>
<talk to Inspector Hughes>
<tell Watson to come here>
> north
You focus your thoughts, and try to go north, and yet nothing seems to
happen...

Watson looks up at you and blinks in surprise.

Constable Phillips sets to work marking out where you’ve fallen, while his
colleague Davis examines your body. Hughes strokes his moustache as he surveys
the stairs. “Looks like an open-and-shut case. Look at ’er nightdress. Must
have got up in the morning and took a tumble down the stairs.”

The morning? No...no, that’s not right. It was just past midnight...you were
trying to find your way downstairs with a torch...you had to get to...the
telephone, wasn’t it? Everything is so fuzzy...

<look at my body>
<look at the constables>
<talk to Inspector Hughes>
<tell Watson to come here>
> zxcvbn
Your mind is still a bit fuzzy, and you can’t quite make sense of that idea at
the moment.

The Inspector turns to go. “For all we know, that bloody dog of hers might have
given her a push.” Watson?! He would never! “I’ll get the coroner in. Davis,
get a report written up and sent to Biddlecombe by the end of today. Looks like
it really was an accident in the end.”

No! That’s it! You woke up, you recognised those symptoms...the choking
feeling, the burning in your stomach—how could you ever mistake the signs of
white arsenic poisoning?

You tried to get to the telephone, but the electricity had gone out again. You
were making your way down with a torch...that’s it, the torch would prove it
was the middle of the night, not the morning, now wouldn’t it? Now where in
heaven’s name did it get off to?

<look at my body>
<look at the constables>
<talk to Inspector Hughes>
<tell Watson to come here>
> watson, north
Watson perks up, about to go north—until one of the constables grabs him by the
collar.

“For once, a nice, open-and-shut case.”

Oh, that small-minded Inspector! Even a perfunctory investigation should find
signs of poison! But he’s so sure it was your ordinary morning routine that he
won’t even consider the possibility.

<look at my body>
<look at the constables>
<talk to Inspector Hughes>
> hughes, wait
Inspector Hughes shows not the slightest hint of recognition. You might as well
be talking to a brick wall.

Hughes strides out while Davis finishes up her measurements. “And get that
bloody creature out of our way!” Suddenly Phillips has grabbed Watson by the
collar and is dragging him off to the sitting room.

Watson’s eyes are fixed on you as he’s pulled away, whimpering and scrabbling
at the carpet. Even if the police won’t listen, Watson will! So you imagine
yourself following him, and the world around you changes...

Miss Gosling’s Last Case
An interactive mystery by Daniel M. Stelzer.
Release 3. Serial number DEBUG.
Dialog Interactive Debugger (dgdebug) version 1a/02. Library version 0.46
(modified).

Sitting room
The big south-facing <windows> in this room give it the best light in the
house, so you always take your breakfast and tea here. Normally it would be
half-filled with your potted plants, but you took those out for Alfred to look
at last week, and you haven’t had a moment to move them back in yet. The room
continues <west> from here, while the hall leads <north> over a small step to
the rest of the house.

Watson’s lead has been looped over the post of <[my favourite chair] your
favourite chair>, keeping him from interfering in the crime scene.

A <rubber ball> lies on the floor nearby.

Your ill-conceived <binocular stand> is fixed in front of the bay window.

In this state, you can’t do much yourself. <Look> around to get a description
of your surroundings, then click the name of an object to examine it, like the
<ball>.

Your score has gone up by one point.

<look> - <Watson>
<go> - <north> - <west>
> * *** Test parser errors ***
> zxcvbn
Watson looks up at you with a sad little whine. He has no idea how to “zxcvbn”.

<look> - <Watson>
<go> - <north> - <west>
> x zxcvbn
Watson understands the instruction to examine something, but doesn’t understand
what. In particular, the word “zxcvbn” seems to be confusing him.

<look> - <Watson>
<go> - <north> - <west>
> sing zxcvbn
Watson wags his tail happily, no comprehension at all in his eyes. In
particular, the word “zxcvbn” seems to be confusing him.

<look> - <Watson>
<go> - <north> - <west>
> * *** Escape ***
> x ball
It’s a hard rubber ball, the sort Watson loves to chew on. You’ve put a treat
inside it for him to try to work out, a little puzzle for him to solve.

If you click the name of something that isn’t close at hand, the game will tell
you where you last saw it. For people, it will also tell you what you remember
about them.

For anything more elaborate than that, you’ll have to rely on Watson. Once
you’ve drawn his attention to something, the link bar will show the various
things he can do with it.

You can also type in commands for Watson directly, like TAKE THE BALL . This is
never truly necessary—the game can be played entirely via links—but can
sometimes be easier than searching for the right link for what you want to
express.

<look> - <Watson>
<go> - <north> - <west>
<the rubber ball> - <[take the rubber ball] take it>
> watson, take ball
(You don’t have to mention Watson’s name explicitly; he’s the only one around
who can hear your commands, after all.)
Watson opens his mouth and carefully scoops up the rubber ball.

Watson can only hold one thing in his mouth at a time, but he’s very good at
manipulating objects in various ways. Anything he’s holding will be shown at
the top of the link bar.

<look> - <Watson> - holding <the rubber ball>
<go> - <north> - <west>
<the rubber ball> - <[drop the rubber ball] drop it> - <[throw the rubber ball]
throw it> - <[bite the rubber ball] bite it> - <[put the rubber ball on] put it
on> (or <[put the rubber ball under] under>) something
> inventory
Watson holds up the rubber ball proudly for your inspection. His <collar> keeps
him from moving more than four feet from the chair.

“Take inventory” is one of the stranger tricks you’ve taught him, but it just
feels more professional than “show me”.

You’ve taught Watson plenty of ways to manipulate objects; the link bar will
suggest the ones that might be useful for a particular thing. Small items can
be picked up or dropped, devices can be switched on or off, doors can be opened
or closed, and so on. Clicking <Watson> will list some of the general tricks
he’s mastered, like “<speak>” and “<roll over>”.

<look> - <Watson> - holding <the rubber ball>
<go> - <north> - <west>
<the rubber ball> - <[drop the rubber ball] drop it> - <[throw the rubber ball]
throw it> - <[bite the rubber ball] bite it> - <[put the rubber ball on] put it
on> (or <[put the rubber ball under] under>) something
> push ball
Watson bats at the toy, but the treat doesn’t come out. It’ll take more force
than that.

A few special commands are always available:
- <UNDO > to take back your last action
- <SAVE > and <RESTORE > to save your game
- <THINK > to list the puzzles you’re facing and the ones you’ve already solved
- <HELP > for a full list of commands
- <ABOUT > for information about the game
- <MAP > to see a map of the house
- <HINTS > if you’re stuck on a puzzle
There are links to these at the top of the page for easy access.

on> (or <[put the rubber ball under] under>) something
> bite ball
Watson gnaws happily at the toy, chomping on it at different angles until the
<treat> inside pops out!

> drop ball
Watson sets the rubber ball carefully under your comfortable chair.

<look> - <Watson>
<go> - <north> - <west>
<the rubber ball> - <[take the rubber ball] take it>

Watson doesn’t need telling twice. Soon there’s nothing left of the treat.

<look> - <Watson>
<go> - <north> - <west>

In what direction?

<look> - <Watson>
<go> - <north> - <west>

comfortable chair] search it> - <[look under my comfortable chair] look under
it> - <[push my comfortable chair] push it>
> w
Watson tugs on his lead, and the chair on its wheels glides smoothly along
behind. You drift after him to the west.

The rubber ball proves too small to foul the wheels, and is left behind.

Evening room
Really this is just another part of the sitting room, but when the house was
modernised and electrified, the west half was lit up and the east half left to
its natural light. So you’ve taken to calling this the evening room, a
comfortable place to sit after supper when you don’t want to brave the stairs
to the library. The stairs themselves end to the <north>, up a small step.

A layer of <[north police tape] police tape> blocks off the door to the north.

Watson’s lead has been looped over the post of <[my favourite chair] your
favourite chair>, keeping him from interfering in the crime scene.

Your <collection of mystery novels> is kept on a <high shelf>, out of Watson’s
reach.

Some people do think it’s odd that you’ve taught him compass directions, but he
would always get so confused between your right and his right. This just works
out better all around.

<look> - <Watson>
<go> - north (<the police tape>) - <east>
<[my comfortable chair] your comfortable chair> - <[jump on my comfortable
chair] jump on it> - <[put something on my comfortable chair] put something on>
(or <[put something under my comfortable chair] under>) it - <[search my
comfortable chair] search it> - <[look under my comfortable chair] look under
it> - <[push my comfortable chair] push it>
> x shelf
You made sure to put the bookshelf high enough that Watson couldn’t reach it.
It’s not that he’d chew on the books; no, he’s far too well-trained for that.
But he has a tendency to knock things over in his excitement. Now your
<paperback murder mysteries> are both safe, and within easy reach. Easy reach
for a human, at least.

<look> - <Watson>
<go> - north (<the police tape>) - <east>
<the bookshelf> - <[jump on the bookshelf] jump on it> - <[put something on the
bookshelf] put something on it> - <[search the bookshelf] search it>
> climb shelf
Watson stretches his body, trying to reach the bookshelf, then settles back
with a sad whimper.

Messages like this, telling you why you can’t do something, often indicate
puzzles to be solved. In this case, the shelf is too high for Watson to reach;
perhaps he could reach it if he were higher up?

<look> - <Watson>

<the bookshelf> - <[jump on the bookshelf] jump on it> - <[put something on the

> books
Most of your books are kept in the library upstairs, of course, but you’ve
turned this room into such a lovely place to read in the evenings, and the
stairs have been getting harder to manage every year. So you’ve started a
collection of paperback mystery novels down here, for when you’re in the mood
for some light reading.

<look> - <Watson> - on <the bookshelf> (<get down>)
<go> - north (<the police tape>) - <east>
<the books> - <[take the books] take them> - <[read the books] read them> -
<[push the books] push them>
> push books
Watson gives the books a vigorous push, sending them off the edge to land on
your comfortable chair.

<look> - <Watson> - on <the bookshelf> (<get down>)
<go> - north (<the police tape>) - <east>
<the books> - <[take the books] take them> - <[read the books] read them> -

Watson leaps off the bookshelf and lands on your comfortable chair.

<look> - <Watson> - on <[my comfortable chair] your comfortable chair> (<get

<go> - north (<the police tape>) - <east>

Watson leaps off your comfortable chair.

<go> - north (<the police tape>) - <east>
<the books> - <[take the books] take them> - <[read the books] read them> -
<[push the books] push them>
> push books
The books tumble around and under the chair’s wheels in a messy pile.

<look> - <Watson>
<go> - north (<the police tape>) - <east>
<the books> - <[take the books] take them> - <[read the books] read them>
> east
(pulling your comfortable chair along)
Watson lopes back east, pulling the chair behind him...until it catches,
pulling him up short. One of your books is trapped under the wheel! But he
keeps pulling, and between the lead on the post pulling it forward and the
caught wheel holding it back, it topples forward with a grand, stately crash.

With the top posts now resting on the floor, the lead is within Watson’s reach,
and with a look of doggy triumph he pulls it free!

Watson is free, and it’s time to solve this case! First, you’ll have to get
back to the scene of the crime: if you can find evidence that this happened at
midnight instead of in the morning, maybe that will convince the constables
that it wasn’t an accident.

Good luck, detective!

Your score has gone up by one point.

<look> - <Watson>
<go> - north (<the police tape>) - <east>
<the books> - <[take the books] take them> - <[read the books] read them>

Watson turns to look westward, then looks back to you with a puzzled whine. He
doesn’t see any way to go that direction.

<look> - <Watson>
<go> - north (<the police tape>) - <east>

Bright yellow tape meant to keep people out of a crime scene. It’s thoroughly
blocking the north door.

<go> - north (<the police tape>) - <east>
<the police tape> - <[bite the police tape] bite it> - <[go through the police

Watson chomps down on the police tape, taking a big chunk out of the middle and
chewing it happily while the ends flutter to the ground.

<the shredded police tape> - <[bite the shredded police tape] bite it> - <[go

> north
Watson saunters through the shredded police tape, and you drift along behind.

Bottom of the stairs
This was once the front room of your house, before you sealed off the door here
and built the larger front room on the other side. Now it just serves as a
little hallway connecting the evening room to the <south> to the dining room to
the <north>. The stairs to the <east> lead up to the first floor.

A layer of <[north police tape] police tape> blocks off the door to the north.

Your <body> lies at the bottom of the stairs.

A big <grate> is set into the floor under the stairs.

Your telephone hangs in its <niche> on the north wall.

Various old <newspapers> are stacked in the corner.

Bright yellow tape meant to keep people out of a crime scene. This one has been
chewed to bits and won’t keep anyone out of anything.

The dining room is that way, but best avoid it for now. If Watson makes a
nuisance of himself, the constables will secure him better next time—you need
to <[look] get to the crime scene> and prove it was murder!

It is, even you have to admit, rather old-fashioned to have a telephone niche.
Most people keep their telephones on tables now. But you always liked how it
looked, so when you upgraded to a modern telephone, you kept it in the old
niche. Things do occasionally roll under it and get lost.

You’ve gathered up the old ones here for Nigel to take the next time he comes
by. There’s something he does with them, and he always takes them off your
hands when they start piling up. It’s possible something could roll behind
them.

Davis scans the room for anything amiss. Nothing, nothing...then Watson barks
again, sniffing at the stack of newspapers, and she takes a closer look.

“What’s this? A torch?” She fishes it out, turning it over in her hand. “Still
on, cells still good. Why would she ’ave had a torch at nine in the morning on
a bright sunny day?”

You watch as it clicks in her head, and she hurries to the telephone.
“Something’s wrong here. I better ring the Inspector and tell the boys at the
lab...”

“...results back from Fletcher at the lab. The Marsh test was positive. Arsenic
poisoning, without a doubt.” Well, obviously; you could have told them yourself
if you’d made it to the phone in time. The constables are gathered around your
dining room table now, listening as Davis summarises the situation. “Given her
experience with poisons, it’s unlikely this was an accident. I think we need to
seriously consider the possibility of foul play.”

Hughes is tugging at his moustache. “Hmph. Quite. Good catch with the torch;
would have been a disgrace for the department if we’d missed that. Now that we
know, we’re not going to leave a single stone unturned. Do we have a motive?
Inheritance?”

“It seems likely. We found a will in her library. Various bequests to charities
and organizations, and four specific people who will benefit quite, well,
substantially.”

“Opportunity?”

Phillips clears his throat. “I’ve been going through her diary.” Inevitable,
you suppose—you would have done the same—but rude nonetheless. “Fletcher says
death occurred between midnight and 2:00 AM, and the poison must have been
consumed—orally—somewhere between four and twelve hours before that. That gives
all four of them the opportunity.”

Hughes furrows his bushy eyebrows. “Four to twelve hours? She had lunch with me
at the King’s Arms yesterday. I’ll be asking some questions around there.”

Davis lays her papers out on the table. “Each of those people had access to her
food or drink within that timespan.” (“Or medication,” Phillips adds.)

“First is her nephew Nigel. That afternoon, he was helping her go through some
records in her attic. It seems she’s got a sort of a laboratory up there, and
he could have tampered with her chemicals.” Nigel? He’d never have the stomach
for it.

“Second is Mrs Charlotte Peabody. Gosling had dinner with her that night, and
specifically mentioned a one-peck bundle of carrots Peabody brought from the
farmer’s market. Gosling ate plenty, but Peabody didn’t touch them.” Well, of
course. Lottie can’t stand the smell of carrots, that’s why she gave them to
you in the first place. “We need to find and test the remaining carrots.”

“Third is Alfred Tucker, her gardener.” Preposterous. “After supper she drank
an herbal tea made with green roses. They must have been gathered from one of
her gardens. Arsenious oxide is sometimes used as a weed killer. If Tucker
applied some to the flower petals, she’d be poisoned some time later, when she
finally made tea from those ones.” Not at all his style. “We need to find the
bush she took these from and test if it’s absorbed anything.”

“Finally, there’s her aide, Emily Morris.” Emily? The girl never had a
malicious thought in her life. “She arranged for all her medications, and could
easily have tampered with them.”

<Hughes> stands, smoothing out his now-frazzled moustache again. “Right then!
<Biddlecombe> will be setting up in the library to handle communications.
<Phillips>, I want you to find and test those medications first thing. They
have to be somewhere in her room. <Davis>, track down the details on those
suspects. We’ll be asking them a few questions. We’ll have this case cracked
right open before it hits the papers!” He glares down at Watson, who’s
snuffling curiously at his hand. “And get that bloody beast out of here!”

Your kitchen isn’t spacious by any stretch of the imagination, but you’ve
always found it cozy rather than cramped. A big door leads <west> to the dining
room, and a smaller one leads <southeast> to your new reception room; the rest
of the house is back to the <south>.

The <dumbwaiter shaft> is set into the north wall.

Dining room
This is the proper place to share a meal with someone, with plenty of windows,
a big <table>, and a lovely <chandelier>. <Display cabinets> along the walls
show off some of your favourite curiosities from your long career; doors lead
<east> to the kitchen and <south> to the rest of the house.

<Constable Davis> herself sits in one of your chairs, hard at work. Her
<paperwork> covers the table.

On the table are a <tape recorder> and your <torch>.

Davis sets her <sandwich> aside as she pulls out another page.

You would never call yourself vain, or overly proud of your success. But you
could never resist showing off a few of your best and most notable
accomplishments. Right now, you have the <evidence from the Disgybl Gwydion
case> laid out here, with some of your other cases displayed in the reception
room and the upstairs balcony.

Davis takes a bite of her <sandwich>.

<look> - <Watson>
<go> - <south> - <east>
<the cabinets>
> evidence
You normally wouldn’t include an unsolved case here...much less one where the
constables never proved there was even a crime committed at all. But it did get
a lot of press, and it did revolve around your house—and you kicked off the
whole thing when you found this notebook during renovations. It seems one of
the previous occupants called himself “Disgybl Gwydion”, claimed to be heir to
the ancient Druids, performing strange rituals in the flower gardens and
seeking eternal life.

...ancestral spirits / lares and penates, bound through belief, worship? / no,
alchemical process-congelation of the soul! See Petrus Catadesmicus, Liber
Animarum / but held to the anchor, how to move and act? / Kizzuwatnan ritual,
the kuwac hapanza - Father’s Encyclopedia vol K p 197 - replaces the nails or
spikes! / must be in the right place... Perhaps the translation the constables
gave you is faulty, or perhaps (as you’ve long suspected) it’s just nonsense.
But it’s a reminder that sometimes there just aren’t answers to be found
anywhere in this world.

Davis sets her <sandwich> aside as she pulls out another page.

You’ve always seen promise in Davis, from when she was just starting out as a
bright-eyed new recruit. But she’s got a certain earnestness you’ve never quite
been able to sway her from. Now she spends most of her time taking every menial
task that’s pushed onto her, thinking straightforward honesty is the best path
to promotion. Eventually, something is bound to shake her enough to take some
initiative of her own...or at least, that was always your hope.

You’d set up a little stand in front of your best window, hoping to attach your

As you speak the word, you feel a strange sensation pulling you southwest...
Watson saunters southwest, and you drift along behind.

Tea garden, southwest
The garden bed under the old walls is just as neat and tidy as ever, as it
should be. The <rosebush> is flourishing, ready for your next cup of tea.

Watson delicately closes his mouth around one of the buds, trying to tear it

Watson saunters northeast, and you drift along behind.

Tea garden, centre
Your tea garden is nestled deep in the foundation of the <old ruins>, the stone
walls rising up on every side to give the plants just the perfect amount of
sunlight and shade. Here at the centre is where you placed that lovely
<fountain>, and a sturdy <chair>, to sit in while you contemplate your options.

Watson saunters north, and you drift along behind.

Lawn
It’s really not big enough to be called the grounds, but you’ve always been
proud of your lawn and gardens, encircling the house on all sides. The most
important one right now is your tea garden, down to the <south>; the veranda is
back to the <north>.

<Today’s newspaper> lies in front of the porch steps.

(attempting to go north)
Watson saunters north, and you drift along behind.

Veranda
A little refuge from the weather, for when you want the fresh outdoor air
without all the sun and the rain, between the <front door> to the <north> and
the lawn to the <south>.

(attempting to go north)
Watson saunters through the front door, and you drift along behind.

Reception room
You designed this room specifically for uninvited guests. Back when the front
door was at the west end of the house, they’d have to wait awkwardly outside
until you had the sitting room or dining room in order. Now, there’s a place to
sit and take tea with them at a moment’s notice—and admire the <framed case
reports> on the wall—and that can make witnesses ever so much more willing to
open up. What used to be the back door of the house leads <northwest> to the
kitchen, and the new <front door> leads out to the <south>.

Today’s <mail> is scattered across the floor.

(attempting to go northwest)
Watson saunters northwest, and you drift along behind.

Kitchen
Your kitchen isn’t spacious by any stretch of the imagination, but you’ve
always found it cozy rather than cramped. A big door leads <west> to the dining
room, and a smaller one leads <southeast> to your new reception room; the rest
of the house is back to the <south>.

The <dumbwaiter shaft> is set into the north wall.

The <stove> is tucked away to one side.

(attempting to go west)
Watson saunters west, and you drift along behind.

Dining room
This is the proper place to share a meal with someone, with plenty of windows,
a big <table>, and a lovely <chandelier>. <Display cabinets> along the walls
show off some of your favourite curiosities from your long career; doors lead
<east> to the kitchen and <south> to the rest of the house.

<Constable Davis> herself sits in one of your chairs, hard at work. Her
<paperwork> covers the table.

On the table are a <tape recorder> and your <torch>.

Davis pulls out another page, cross-checking it against the last.

“Hm? What’s this?” The constable looks down at the torn branch in Watson’s
mouth.

“Wait—is this—?” She takes it carefully, avoiding the thorns and the dog
slobber. “The green roses! This must be from the same bush as the tea she drank
last night! The boffins at the lab will need a look at this.”

Watson sits back and wags his tail happily as Davis hurries off. It will take
some time for the laboratory tests to come back, but you already know what
they’ll say: that the roses weren’t poisoned, and Alfred is innocent.

Your score has gone up by one point.

The stairs turn around sharply here at a little wooden landing, just a foot or
so above the ground. The <pump> here is supposed to keep your cellar from
flooding, but with the electricity out, you have to fear the worst. The cellar
proper is down to the <northeast>, in total darkness without the light from the
hall windows, or you can go back up to the <east>.

<Lottie> left it when she was over for dinner, filled with photos of her trip
out to the Orient. Her son is some sort of archaeologist out there, with his
wife, and she loved talking about all the intricate details of what they were
doing. Fiddly details have always been her favourite thing, and she kept
pushing you to keep working on those constabulary records that weren’t lining
up—she just had a feeling it was a sign of something worse.

Lottie—that is, Mrs Charlotte Peabody—is your closest friend in the area, and
her regular visits for tea and gossip are a highlight of your week. She’s a
meticulous, analytical sort, always picking out the flaws in a plan; if she
turned her mind to murder, she would have a better alibi and a less obvious
method.

Unfortunately, she isn’t anywhere near your house at the moment.

That’s that “magic word” Nigel was on about, from some new game he found? You
don’t understand any of it, really, but he seems to enjoy it at least.

Davis flips one of the sheets over, tapping her pen against the table.

> give carrots to davis
Davis looks down at Watson, and winces at the sight of water being dripped all
over your rug. (Well, it can’t be helped.) It takes her a moment more to
realise what exactly it’s dripping from.

“The carrots!” Watson lets go obligingly as she heaves the bundle up onto the
table, trying to keep it from soaking her paperwork. “Don’t know how you knew
we needed these, but I’ll get them to the lab right away. Thanks, boy.”

Watson sits back with a proud smile as Davis makes the arrangements, though he
seems a bit sad not to be given a carrot himself for his efforts. The lab tests
will take a while, but you’re confident they’ll come back clean. Lottie is
innocent.

Your score has gone up by one point.

Watson saunters through the shredded police tape, and you drift along behind.

Bottom of the stairs
This was once the front room of your house, before you sealed off the door here
and built the larger front room on the other side. Now it just serves as a
little hallway connecting the evening room to the <south> to the dining room to
the <north>. The stairs to the <east> lead up to the first floor.

Your <body> lies at the bottom of the stairs.

A big <grate> is set into the floor under the stairs.

Your telephone hangs in its <niche> on the north wall.

Various old <newspapers> are stacked in the corner.

Watson saunters up the stairs, and you drift along behind.

Top of the stairs
The afternoon light coming through the big <windows> makes the first floor look
so cheerful and pleasant, and not at all like the place someone fell to her
death just last night. It’s better that way; you’ve never wanted this house to
look dreary by any stretch of the imagination. Identical doors lead <north> and
<south> to your library and master suite, respectively; the hallway continues
to the <northwest>, and the <stairs> lead back down to the <west>.

Upstairs hall
The hall runs alongside the staircase here before bending sharply at the end,
with a little balcony to the <south> overlooking the first floor. The top of
the stairs is back to the <southeast>, and the guest room will be to the
<north>—once it’s been properly repainted and made livable, at least.

A dangling cord marks the location of the <trapdoor> to the attic.

A <mattress> is propped up against one wall, for lack of anywhere better to put

Davis settles back into her chair and returns to work.

Watson leaps upward and catches the cord in his teeth, trying to hold onto it
with all his strength. For a moment it doesn’t seem like his weight will be
enough...but with a steady groan the trapdoor opens and the stairs swing
downward. His momentum carries him off to the south, depositing him with a
gentle thump on the balcony.

The hallway ends with a narrow <balcony>, connecting your bedroom to the

With a mighty heave, Watson shoves the mattress over the edge! It tumbles end-

it lands with a mighty whomp at the foot of the stairs.

Well, at least you won’t have to look at your own corpse any more.

drifting down with him as he plummets down the stairs and lands with a whump on
the mattress below.

mouth. With a sharp tug the shutters all around the attic snap open, and the
afternoon sunlight streams in.

Attic, south (on the grandfather clock)
There are only two real rooms in the attic: the laboratory, in the center, and
everything else, forming a huge ring around it. This is the south side of that
ring, packed to the gills with the <clutter> of a life well lived.

In the afternoon sunlight, you can just barely trace the outline of the <vents>
under the carpet.

You see your <torch> here.

The <grandfather clock> looms just under the windows.

Off to the northeast, you can clearly see an <organ>. Watson could probably
make that leap.

Your score has gone up by one point.

Watson paws at the carpet for a moment, but can’t find a way to open it without
just chewing through. And surely that’s not what you want.

> chew carpet
You kneel down and guide Watson’s nose to the right place, and he starts
scratching at the carpet with furious intensity. He doesn’t get the opportunity
to dig very often, and he’s determined to make the most of this moment. Soon a
corner tears free, revealing the vent hidden underneath.

You can’t see Watson moving, but as he scrabbles through the vents, you find
yourself pulled along to the north.

Laboratory (in the floor vents)
At the very center of the attic is the laboratory, where you spend your spare
time tinkering with chemicals. <Nigel> jokes that you’re a fairy-tale witch
updated to the twentieth century, but it’s been plenty of help with cases in
the past—and besides, everyone needs a hobby.

The <door> leads out to the <east>, thankfully easier to open from this side.

In the afternoon sunlight, you can just barely trace the outline of the <vents>
under the carpet.

Your <box of poisons> lies in the midst of the <equipment>, clearly labelled
for safety.

There’s a scratching, scrabbling noise as Watson struggles to get his teeth and
claws into the carpet—followed by a loud, satisfying rip. His head emerges from
the floor, tongue lolling out happily.

The <door> to your laboratory stands open to the <west>.

In the afternoon sunlight, you can just barely trace the outline of the <vents>
under the carpet.

A <reed organ> is positioned against the inner wall.

Off to the northwest, you can clearly see a <victrola>. Watson might be able to
leap to it, from the right starting point.

Off to the southwest, you can clearly see a <grandfather clock>. Watson might
be able to leap to it, from the right starting point.

The collapsible stairs lead down through the trapdoor to the rest of the house.

Off to the southeast, you can clearly see a <grandfather clock>. Watson might

(attempting to go down)
Watson clambers down the attic stairs, and you drift along behind.

Upstairs hall
The hall runs alongside the staircase here before bending sharply at the end,
with a little balcony to the <south> overlooking the first floor. The top of
the stairs is back to the <southeast>, and the guest room will be to the
<north>—once it’s been properly repainted and made livable, at least.

The <trapdoor> to the attic is open, the collapsible steps leading up to the
<south>.

(attempting to go southeast)
Watson saunters southeast, and you drift along behind.

Top of the stairs
The afternoon light coming through the big <windows> makes the first floor look
so cheerful and pleasant, and not at all like the place someone fell to her
death just last night. It’s better that way; you’ve never wanted this house to
look dreary by any stretch of the imagination. Identical doors lead <north> and
<south> to your library and master suite, respectively; the hallway continues
to the <northwest>, and the <stairs> lead back down to the <west>.

From the sound of it, <Phillips> is hard at work in the suite to the <south>.

(attempting to go west)
Watson saunters down the stairs, and you drift along behind.

Bottom of the stairs
This was once the front room of your house, before you sealed off the door here
and built the larger front room on the other side. Now it just serves as a
little hallway connecting the evening room to the <south> to the dining room to
the <north>. The stairs to the <east> lead up to the first floor.

A <mattress> lies at the bottom of the stairs, where you fell.

A big <grate> is set into the floor under the stairs.

Your telephone hangs in its <niche> on the north wall.

Various old <newspapers> are stacked in the corner.

(attempting to go north)
Watson saunters through the shredded police tape, and you drift along behind.

Dining room
This is the proper place to share a meal with someone, with plenty of windows,
a big <table>, and a lovely <chandelier>. <Display cabinets> along the walls
show off some of your favourite curiosities from your long career; doors lead
<east> to the kitchen and <south> to the rest of the house.

<Constable Davis> herself sits in one of your chairs, hard at work. Her
<paperwork> covers the table.

Davis runs her hands through her hair with a sigh.

<look> - <Watson> - holding <the box of poisons>
<go> - <south> - <east>
> give poisons to davis
“What’s this now?” Watson pushes the box insistently into Davis’s hands, and
she has to turn it around to read it. “Poisons? Now where on earth did you get
this?” She extricates it carefully from his mouth, and opens it to see the
assortment of carefully-labelled vials inside. “This would be from her
laboratory, then? The nephew could have tampered with them—you,” she looks
severely at Watson, “need to be more careful! It could have poisoned you too.”

She seals the box again. “The fingerprints will tell us one way or another.”
But you already know the answer; Nigel isn’t the sort to do a thing like that.
The tests will prove him innocent.

Your kitchen isn’t spacious by any stretch of the imagination, but you’ve
always found it cozy rather than cramped. A big door leads <west> to the dining
room, and a smaller one leads <southeast> to your new reception room; the rest
of the house is back to the <south>.

The <dumbwaiter shaft> is set into the north wall.

The <stove> is tucked away to one side.

Watson saunters southeast, and you drift along behind.

Reception room
You designed this room specifically for uninvited guests. Back when the front
door was at the west end of the house, they’d have to wait awkwardly outside
until you had the sitting room or dining room in order. Now, there’s a place to
sit and take tea with them at a moment’s notice—and admire the <framed case
reports> on the wall—and that can make witnesses ever so much more willing to
open up. What used to be the back door of the house leads <northwest> to the
kitchen, and the new <front door> leads out to the <south>.

Today’s <mail> is scattered across the floor.

Davis makes her way from the kitchen to the dining room.

“Fastidious” is perhaps the best word to describe the young constable, so
insistent on doing everything by the book. You always appreciate his
thoroughness in searching for clues, now that you’re in no state to be bending
down and dusting for fingerprints under automobiles and such, but he’ll never
be promoted if he can’t learn to put the pieces together himself. When he’s set
himself to a task, nothing short of an absolute emergency will sway him from
his course.

Currently, he should be in <the kitchen>.

Bedroom
As your age advances, the little luxuries of your bedroom have suffered for it.
Even with Emily’s help, you’ve had to recognise the difficulties in day-to-day

comfortable. The suite opens out to the <east>, and a <door> to the <north>

You got this from the constables, at <[emily] Emily’s> insistence; she
maintains that someone you exposed will eventually want revenge, and having a
weapon on hand will make them think twice about coming into your house. She
means well, but she’s never quite understood how these things actually
happen—you have no idea how to use something like this effectively, and a
person bent on murder won’t be dissuaded by it.

You used to feel a bit ashamed to admit it, but a companion really is a
necessity at your age. She checks in on you periodically, arranges your
medicines, and handles any problems before they come up; not the brightest
girl, perhaps, but a very good heart. She’d be horrified by the very idea of
murder, and probably end up in tears for even thinking about it.

Unfortunately, she isn’t anywhere near your house at the moment.

Master suite
Such a grand name for what amounts to five feet of hallway-slash-closet,
connecting your bedroom to the <west> to your bathroom to the <northeast>. The

Your <racks of clothes> stand in disarray, methodically ransacked by the

Watson saunters northeast, and you drift along behind.

Bathroom
Watson is far more excited about this room than you are—it’s normally off-
limits to him, and the <sink>, <bath>, and <toilet> are all mysterious and new.
The only exit leads back <southwest>.

You keep your medicines in a mirrored <cabinet> to one side.

More a functional piece of furniture than a beautiful one, it works as both a
full-length mirror and a place to keep your medicines and toiletries. You don’t
normally lock it, though; what would be the point, in your own bathroom?

You only wish it could be set into the wall, instead of free-standing. The
baseboards keep it from standing quite flush, leaving an inch or so of space
behind it, and you can see a <glint> of something caught back there.

Watson gives the truncheon a vigorous tug, and for a moment, it seems like
nothing will happen. But he tugs again, and the cabinet wavers—and slowly
begins to topple forward! He darts out of the way as the whole cabinet comes
crashing down, the mirror shattering into hundreds of pieces on the tiles.

Your <medicine box> now lies amid the wreckage.

death just last night. It’s better that way; you’ve never wanted this house to
look dreary by any stretch of the imagination. Identical doors lead <north> and

This was once the front room of your house, before you sealed off the door here
and built the larger front room on the other side. Now it just serves as a
little hallway connecting the evening room to the <south> to the dining room to
the <north>. The stairs to the <east> lead up to the first floor.

A <mattress> lies at the bottom of the stairs, where you fell. On the mattress
is a <medicine chest>.

A big <grate> is set into the floor under the stairs.

Upstairs hall
The hall runs alongside the staircase here before bending sharply at the end,
with a little balcony to the <south> overlooking the first floor. The top of
the stairs is back to the <southeast>, and the guest room will be to the

Attic, west
There are only two real rooms in the attic: the laboratory, in the center, and
everything else, forming a huge ring around it. This is the west side of that
ring, packed to the gills with the <clutter> of a life well lived.

The collapsible stairs lead down through the trapdoor to the rest of the house.

In the afternoon sunlight, you can just barely trace the outline of the <vents>
under the carpet.

Off to the northeast, you can clearly see a <victrola>. Watson might be able to

Off to the southeast, you can clearly see a <grandfather clock>. Watson might

In the afternoon sunlight, you can just barely trace the outline of the <vents>

Davis runs her hands through her hair with a sigh.

Kitchen
Your kitchen isn’t spacious by any stretch of the imagination, but you’ve
always found it cozy rather than cramped. A big door leads <west> to the dining

of the house is back to the <south>.

The <dumbwaiter> is here, with a <broken medicine chest> and a <tape recorder>

The <stove> is tucked away to one side. On the stove is some <mail>.

You keep your various medicines locked in a little frosted-glass box, just in

Your pill box is hidden inside.

Watson has to nudge Davis’s hand a few times with the pill box before she hears
it rattling. “What’s this? Is this—are these the pills Phillips was turning the
bedroom upside down for?” She actually laughs as he drops it in her hand. “How
did you find these before he did? Such a good dog!” She opens the box and
counts out the remaining pills. “I’ll get these down to the lab, and they’ll
know if anyone tampered with them.” They didn’t, of course; Emily is the only
one to have the opportunity, and she’s too diligent to make that mistake. But
this will confirm it, and rule her out once and for all.

Some time later, Davis is back in the dining room, going over the files. “This
doesn’t make sense. There were only four people with a motive and an
opportunity...but no evidence pointing toward any of them. How else could it
’ave happened?”

She looks down at Watson, as if he’s going to have an answer for her, then
stands. “I’m getting the other two. We need a new direction.” Biddlecombe is
promptly summoned down from the <library>, and Phillips from wherever he’s
gotten off to; soon all three of them are huddled together around the table,

Watson saunters through the library door, and you drift along behind.

Library
Nobody else ever likes this room. They say the <carpets> and the <drapes> clash
horribly with the <bookshelves>, and they can never find what they’re looking
for. But that really doesn’t matter; it’s a place for you to work, study, and
read, and to your eyes, the colours are perfectly fine. The only <door> leads
back to the <south>.

The dumbwaiter used to run through here, but you covered over the <shaft> when
you turned the room into a library. There was just too much risk of something
spilling out.

<look> - <Watson>

Apparently they’re an odd mixture of purple, orange, and red that clashes
horribly with the <shelves>, but to you, they go together very well.

The shelves line every wall, leaving no real place to work—your desk, after
all, is hidden in the niche behind them. All you have to do now is open it.

It’s very simple, if you know the trick. You direct Watson to pull one
particular book off the shelf, then a second, then a third—and as the last one
falls, the cases swing silently outward to reveal your <desk> in the niche
behind them. It’s still covered with those <ledgers and files> from last week;
you kept meaning to get back to that investigation...

It is, perhaps, not truly necessary to hide your desk behind a bookcase. But
when you came across a mechanism like this in one of your investigations, you
simply couldn’t resist. Now your workspace is tucked away behind the shelves
when it’s not being used.

Dozens of records and ledgers from the constabulary are laid out here,
carefully arranged so you can compare them side by side. This isn’t the sort of
business you normally do, but the Inspector had remarked a few weeks back that
their auditors couldn’t make heads nor tails of the discrepancies, and you
thought it might be linked to something deeper. Really, you started to regret
it by the third page, which is why you left it sitting here for a week and a
half.

But being murdered does tend to lend some urgency to things. You settle
yourself over the desk and direct Watson how to push the papers around, letting
you look for the patterns you need. It’s tedious work, but you don’t seem to
grow tired the way you used to.

None of these discrepancies make sense. Their bookkeeping isn’t just atrocious:
it seems designed to be as confusing as possible. But the only person with the
authority to cause that sort of snarl...

...would be the Inspector himself.

Your score has gone up by one point.

Watson lets out a loud bark that echoes through the house, then looks up at you
for approval, tail wagging happily.

Off in the dining room, Davis steadfastly ignores the sound. She’s
investigating a murder now, and can’t be distracted by barking dogs!

<Constable Davis> herself sits in one of your chairs, hard at work. Her
<paperwork> covers the table.

Davis is hurriedly gathering up the most important files. “I have to get this
all in order—the Inspector is on his way!” She spares Watson a quick,
apologetic glance, then hurries out of the room.

So Hughes is coming. He’ll never let the other constables see the evidence now.
But this isn’t time to panic; it’s time to act.

You know exactly where he’s going to be: in the library, destroying the
ledgers. You have a chance. Push him hard enough and he’ll slip—and give you
the evidence you need for a conviction.

Barely a moment later the door slams open and Inspector Hughes strides in, his
bulky frame wrapped in an enormous overcoat. “None of the suspects, she says.
All four of the theories ruled out. Have to look deeper. And Biddlecombe
doesn’t find a single bloody thing. It’s time to take care of this myself.”

> hughes
You have a long history with Basil Hughes, and it’s in no small part thanks to
your investigations that he’s risen through the ranks from Constable to
Inspector. He has his eye on Chief Inspector now, but really, well...the man is
far too close-minded, far too quick to jump to the obvious conclusion. Large
and stout, with an immaculate uniform and an impressive moustache, he tries to
look every bit the image of the modern constabulary.

“Now, what have we here?” <Hughes> sets his <briefcase> on the desk.

> bite hughes
You’ve trained Watson well not to get aggressive with people, but he’s smart
enough to understand the anger behind that command—he leaps at the Inspector
with a growl, teeth bared to bite! Hughes does his best to fend him off, but
his Inverness coat now has some dramatic new tears.

“Shoo! Get out of here! Go!” With a hiss of displeasure, <Hughes> turns back to
the desk.

Watson needs very little encouragement to throw himself upon the Inspector,
lavishing him with distinctly unwanted canine affection. Hughes tries his
hardest to push him away, but Watson is undeterred, and by the time the
Inspector fights free his face and hands are thoroughly wet.

“Shoo! Get out of here! Go!” With a hiss of displeasure, <Hughes> turns back to
the desk.

You’ve trained Watson well not to do such things in the house, but you’ve also
trained him to recognise an emergency—and this certainly qualifies. Hughes
freezes in his work as he hears the telltale sound behind him.

“Shoo! Get out of here! Go!” With a hiss of displeasure, <Hughes> turns back to
the desk.

The moment Hughes’s back is turned, Watson reaches up and gives his briefcase a
mighty shove, sending it to the floor. The Inspector whirls around a moment too
late to stop him from snatching it up, and he’s off on a merry chase!

Watson manages to evade the constable for a good while before Hughes eventually
manages to snag his case back, puffing and panting for breath.

“Shoo! Get out of here! Go!” With a hiss of displeasure, <Hughes> turns back to
the desk.

<Hughes> flips through another ledger, grumbling under his breath.

> jump on desk
Watson’s tail wags for a moment, and the Inspector has only a moment of warning
before he leaps up onto the desk, papers flying everywhere! Hughes shouts
something incoherent and tries to push him aside, his work now scattered all
over the room.

“Wretched mutt! You’re as bad as she was!” <Hughes> visibly composes himself
for a moment before going back to his task.

<look> - <Watson>
<go> - <south>
<[my desk] your desk> - <[jump on my desk] jump on it> - <[put something on my
desk] put something on it> - <[search my desk] search it>
> bark
Positioning himself right behind Hughes’s work, Watson waits for the perfect
moment to let out a thunderous bark. The Inspector jumps, clenching his hand so
hard on a pen that it snaps in half.

“ENOUGH!” Hughes whirls on Watson, rage burning on his face. “You confounded
beast! I had it all arranged! There was no evidence to be found! We’d file it
as an accident and close the case, or send Davis and Phillips on a snipe hunt
until the case went cold! But you, you had to get in my way at every single
turn!”

He snatches up a stack of papers and starts to shred them between his hands.
“But it’s not enough. This was the last evidence of the motive, and without it,
they’ll never even begin to investigate. This house is going up for auction,
and you’re going to the pound!”

He aims a petty kick at Watson as he flings the door open and storms out of the
room.

“Hm? What’s’at?” Davis sounds exhausted as she looks down at the recorder. “Ah,
you found this for us. Thanks, dog.” She checks the tape, then rewinds it and
taps ‘play’.

There’s a minute of muffled silence, the sounds of someone rifling around in
the library, and Davis frowns. But then Hughes’s voice comes through loud and
clear. I had it all arranged! There was no evidence to be found! We’d file it
as an accident and close the case, or send Davis and Phillips on a snipe hunt
until the case went cold!

The recorder falls from the constable’s hand with a crash. “Inspector Hughes?
He—why—”

Watson sits back on his haunches, panting happily as Davis grabs the recorder
and sprints off. Finally taking her own initiative, for once in her life; you
wish you could tell her you were proud. She’s the sort who will dot all the i’s
and cross all the t’s, and with a confession like that, Hughes has no way to
wiggle out of it.

The front door slams, and you’re left alone in the silence. Davis will get the
credit, of course, but you don’t mind that; you’ve had plenty of glory in your
time. Someone else can get the accolades for solving your own murder. And Nigel
will take good care of Watson; your will is explicit on that point.

Watson leaps out of the bath.

Water pours from the bathtub faucet, straight down the drain.

Water rushes through the sink.

Watson saunters southwest, and you drift along behind.

Master suite
Such a grand name for what amounts to five feet of hallway-slash-closet,
connecting your bedroom to the <west> to your bathroom to the <northeast>. The
door to the <north> leads out to the rest of the house.

Your <racks of clothes> stand in disarray, methodically ransacked by the
constables.

(attempting to go north)
Watson saunters out the suite door, and you drift along behind.

Top of the stairs
The afternoon light coming through the big <windows> makes the first floor look
so cheerful and pleasant, and not at all like the place someone fell to her
death just last night. It’s better that way; you’ve never wanted this house to
look dreary by any stretch of the imagination. Identical doors lead <north> and
<south> to your library and master suite, respectively; the hallway continues
to the <northwest>, and the <stairs> lead back down to the <west>.

You see a <smoke detector> here.

(attempting to go west)
Watson saunters down the stairs, and you drift along behind.

Bottom of the stairs
This was once the front room of your house, before you sealed off the door here
and built the larger front room on the other side. Now it just serves as a
little hallway connecting the evening room to the <south> to the dining room to
the <north>. The stairs to the <east> lead up to the first floor.

A <mattress> lies at the bottom of the stairs, where you fell.

A big <grate> is set into the floor under the stairs.

Your telephone hangs in its <niche> on the north wall.

Various old <newspapers> are stacked in the corner.

(attempting to go north)
Watson saunters through the shredded police tape, and you drift along behind.

Dining room
This is the proper place to share a meal with someone, with plenty of windows,
a big <table>, and a lovely <chandelier>. <Display cabinets> along the walls
show off some of your favourite curiosities from your long career; doors lead
<east> to the kitchen and <south> to the rest of the house.

You see a <tape recorder> here.

<Constable Davis> herself sits in one of your chairs, hard at work. Her
<paperwork> covers the table.

Davis looks for her biscuit, realises she’s run out, and sighs.

(attempting to go east)
Watson saunters east, and you drift along behind.

Kitchen
Your kitchen isn’t spacious by any stretch of the imagination, but you’ve
always found it cozy rather than cramped. A big door leads <west> to the dining
room, and a smaller one leads <southeast> to your new reception room; the rest
of the house is back to the <south>.

The <dumbwaiter> is here, with a <broken medicine chest> in it.

The <stove> is tucked away to one side.

(attempting to go southeast)
Watson saunters southeast, and you drift along behind.

Reception room
You designed this room specifically for uninvited guests. Back when the front
door was at the west end of the house, they’d have to wait awkwardly outside
until you had the sitting room or dining room in order. Now, there’s a place to
sit and take tea with them at a moment’s notice—and admire the <framed case
reports> on the wall—and that can make witnesses ever so much more willing to
open up. What used to be the back door of the house leads <northwest> to the
kitchen, and the new <front door> leads out to the <south>.

<look> - <Watson> - holding <the mail>
<go> - south (<the front door>) - <northwest>
> open door
Watson noses the front door open.

<look> - <Watson> - holding <the mail>
<go> - <south> - <northwest>
<the front door> - <[close the front door] close it> - <[go through the front
door] go through>
> find calendulas
Watson leaps up and sprints off in hot pursuit of the calendula, heading for
the northeast bed.

(attempting to go south)
Watson saunters out the front door, and you drift along behind.

Veranda
A little refuge from the weather, for when you want the fresh outdoor air
without all the sun and the rain, between the <front door> to the <north> and
the lawn to the <south>.

(attempting to go south)
Watson saunters south, and you drift along behind.

Lawn
It’s really not big enough to be called the grounds, but you’ve always been
proud of your lawn and gardens, encircling the house on all sides. The most
important one right now is your tea garden, down to the <south>; the veranda is
back to the <north>.

<Today’s newspaper> lies in front of the porch steps.

(attempting to go south)
Watson saunters south, and you drift along behind.

Tea garden, centre
Your tea garden is nestled deep in the foundation of the <old ruins>, the stone
walls rising up on every side to give the plants just the perfect amount of
sunlight and shade. Here at the centre is where you placed that lovely
<fountain>, and a sturdy <chair>, to sit in while you contemplate your options.

The garden beds themselves are arranged in a ring around you, and the path
<north> leads back to the lawn. You have a lovely view of the whole thing from
your <sitting room>.

On the garden chair are a pair of <gardening gloves>.

(attempting to go northeast)
Watson saunters northeast, and you drift along behind.

Tea garden, northeast
The garden bed under the old walls is just as neat and tidy as ever, as it
should be. The <calendula> is flourishing, ready for your next cup of tea.

<look> - <Watson> - holding <the mail>
<go> - <west> - <southwest> - <southeast>
<the calendula> - <[bite the calendula] bite it>
> dig calendulas
Normally, Watson would be too well-trained to obey an order like that. He knows
perfectly well that your garden is not for digging. And yet...he knows that
there’s something odd here, different from all the rest.

He throws himself into the work with great enthusiasm, uprooting your poor
calendulas left and right, until with an awful lurch the garden bed collapses
in on itself and sinks down into something underneath! This must be where the
old cistern was, long ago; you’d been told the house had one when you bought
it, but you never saw it yourself.

<look> - <Watson> - holding <the mail>
<go> - <west> - <southwest> - <southeast> - <down>
<the calendula> - <[bite the calendula] bite it>
> down
Watson clambers down the messy tunnel, and you drift along behind.

Old cistern
The old cistern isn’t especially large, and if you still had a body, you
wouldn’t be able to stand up without hitting your head. <Lichen> covers the old
stones, and in one corner they’ve crumbled away entirely into some sort of
cavern beneath.

A <messy hole> leads back to the garden above.

Your score has gone up by one point.

<look> - <Watson> - holding <the mail>
<go> - <up> - <down>
> down
Watson clambers down, and you drift along behind.

Ancient chamber
This place cannot exist. It simply can’t. You can’t even stop your cellar from
flooding, for goodness’ sake; how could a chamber like this possibly stay dry?
For that matter, how can you even see Watson three feet in front of you, with
no light coming down from the surface?

And yet somehow it does, fifteen feet wide and round like a dome, the ancient
walls crumbling with <lichen>. A roughly-hewn <slab of stone> stands right in
the middle.

<look> - <Watson> - holding <the mail>
<go> - <up>
> get on altar
Watson leaps up onto the stone slab.

<look> - <Watson> - holding <the mail>
<go> - <up>
<the stone slab> - <[put something on the stone slab] put something on it> -
<[search the stone slab] search it>
> bite mail
You’re not quite sure what to expect when Watson sinks his teeth into the mail.
Some part of you remains convinced that it’s all nonsense. Another part is
being steadily forced to accept the existence of ghosts, which you have
steadfastly refused to accept as an explanation for murder for the past fifty-
some years.

Whatever you expected, it wasn’t this.

It feels like your whole spirit is being forced through a funnel just over your
heart, drawn out and twisted into a cord, needled through the mail like a
thread through cloth. You become your name, and your name becomes you, and
Watson—

Nothing has changed, and at the same time, everything has changed. You feel no
more solid than before. But in some strange way, you’re more real. More certain
that your story isn’t quite yet reaching its end.

Your score has gone up by one point.

<look> - <Watson> - holding <the mail>
<go> - <up>
<the mail> - <[drop the mail] drop it> - <[throw the mail] throw it> - <[bite
the mail] bite it> - <[read the mail] read it> - <[put the mail on] put it on>
something
> drop mail
Watson sets the mail carefully on the stone slab.

<look> - <Watson> - on <the stone slab> (<get down>)
<go> - <up>
<the mail> - <[take the mail] take it> - <[read the mail] read it> - <[push the
mail] push it>
> find davis
Watson leaps up and sprints off in hot pursuit of Constable Davis, heading for
the dining room.

The garden bed under the old walls is just as neat and tidy as ever, as it

A large <sinkhole> in the middle of the garden bed thoroughly disrupts the
aesthetic.

(attempting to go southwest)
Watson saunters southwest, and you drift along behind.

Your tea garden is nestled deep in the foundation of the <old ruins>, the stone

(attempting to go north)
Watson saunters through the front door, and you drift along behind.

always found it cozy rather than cramped. A big door leads <west> to the dining
room, and a smaller one leads <southeast> to your new reception room; the rest
of the house is back to the <south>.

You see a <tape recorder> here.

<Constable Davis> herself sits in one of your chairs, hard at work. Her
<paperwork> covers the table.

Davis pulls out another page, cross-checking it against the last.

<look> - <Watson>
<go> - <south> - <east>
<Constable Davis> - <[push constable davis] push her> - <[kiss constable davis]
kiss her> - <[show something to constable davis] show something to her>
> get recorder
Watson opens his mouth and carefully scoops up the tape recorder.

Davis looks for her biscuit, realises she’s run out, and sighs.

<look> - <Watson> - holding <the tape recorder>
<go> - <south> - <east>
<the tape recorder> - <[drop the tape recorder] drop it> - <[throw the tape
recorder] throw it> - <[put the tape recorder on] put it on> something - <[show
the tape recorder to constable davis] show it to Constable Davis> - <[push off]
OFF> - <[push rec] REC> - <[push play] PLAY>
> give recorder to davis
“Hm? What’s’at?” Davis sounds exhausted as she looks down at the recorder. “Ah,
you found this for us. Thanks, dog.” She checks the tape, then rewinds it and
taps ‘play’.

There’s a minute of muffled silence, the sounds of someone rifling around in
the library, and Davis frowns. But then Hughes’s voice comes through loud and
clear. I had it all arranged! There was no evidence to be found! We’d file it
as an accident and close the case, or send Davis and Phillips on a snipe hunt
until the case went cold!

The recorder falls from the constable’s hand with a crash. “Inspector Hughes?
He—why—”

Watson sits back on his haunches, panting happily as Davis grabs the recorder
and sprints off. Finally taking her own initiative, for once in her life; you
wish you could tell her you were proud. She’s the sort who will dot all the i’s
and cross all the t’s, and with a confession like that, Hughes has no way to
wiggle out of it.

The front door slams, and you’re left alone in the silence. Davis will get the
credit, of course, but you don’t mind that; you’ve had plenty of glory in your
time. Someone else can get the accolades for solving your own murder.

The real question is—what comes next for you? That odd ritual seems to have
bound your soul to Watson, and that binding shows no signs of fading. You look
down at Watson, who’s sitting back on his haunches, panting happily. You might
not know what the next chapter in your story will bring, but it certainly won’t
be the last.

Congratulations on solving the metapuzzle and reaching the true ending! This
puzzle was run as a competition during IFComp 2024, with the prize won by S. V.
Linwood.
