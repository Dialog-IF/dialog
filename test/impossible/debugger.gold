What a mess! The hurricane did a real number on the old <family home>, and to
think it would happen the week that your dad is moving out!

You notice some movement from an upstairs window. A woman that looks somewhat
familiar leans out and throws out a <paper airplane> that floats down and lands
by you.

"There you go, CJ! See you at dinner!" she shouts, then slams the window shut.

"Huh. Who the heck was that?" you say to yourself.

Front Lawn
You are standing in front of your family home, which you recently purchased
from your father. The front door is to the <east>.

The <paper airplane> is lying on the ground next to you.

[<Look>, <Inventory>, <East> and <in>;]

You scoop up the airplane and un-fold it. It's a... <chores list>?

The list says "BEFORE THE GUESTS ARRIVE:" in all caps at the top. At the bottom
it says,

-Give the good serving dish to Uncle Joe

-Put the plates on the table

-Find Mom's baklava recipe and make it

-Help Ada finish up in the garage (could take a while)

-Remind Uncle Rob about dinner

Huh. Strange.

You're still feeling a bit frazzled from the hurricane and helping your dad
pack for his big move, but otherwise you're doing fine.

[<Look>, <Inventory>, <Goals>; <East> and <in>;]
> x house
You moved into this place pretty soon after your mother passed away, although
she helped design it. It's not very big, but it has a lot of great memories in
it.

It's too bad that the hurricane damaged it quite a bit. You can't see it from
here, but it's even worse in the kitchen.

(first attempting to open the front door to the east)
You open the front door.

You walk into the house (your house, now) and close the door behind you.

Family Room
This cramped family room is dominated by a massive entertainment center and has
burgundy carpeting. Unlike the rest of the house, it hasn't been hit hard by
the hurricane.

There is a <calendar> on the wall. The office is to the <south>, the garage is
<north>, the kitchen is <east>, and the stairs go <up> and <down>. The front
door is to the <west>.

[<Look>, <Inventory>, <Goals>; <Up>, <down>, <east>, <north>, <south>, and

This massive entertainment center is designed to hold your TV and all of its
attachments. You haven't moved in your TV yet. You'll do that after dad moves
out.

You bought this carpet to be unique, but it turns out all the homeowners in the
neighborhood had the same idea.

This calendar is a little warped from the water, but it still works. It's a
calendar with pictures of wolves. You got it at Borders. It's August 20th,
2001.

You start to head out before you remember: The garage was crushed by the tree
in your backyard when the hurricane blew it over a few days ago. There's no way
out there right now.

Your cousin Ada was so sad about losing her projects, she hasn't been back
since.

You walk south.

Office
This is your art studio. Or, at least, it will be. Right now, it's mostly
empty, except for a single easel in the middle and a <pedestal>. Your family's
<memory board> is here, the only thing you kept from your dad's old office. The
shelves and most of the books had to be thrown out.

The family room is back to the <north>.

On the pedestal, you can see a <dish towel>, artfully arranged.

Your <[dad] dad> is puttering around, making sure that your new studio is ready
for you to move into.

"Oh hey, CJ," he says, looking up for a second.

[<Look>, <Inventory>, <Goals>; <North>;]
> x easel
It cost a little more than you budgeted for, but you hope it will suffice for
the next few years, at least.

[<Look>, <Inventory>, <Goals>; <North>; easel: <Examine it>, <Take it>]

This hefty pedestal is where you intend to put your current inspiration. Your
choice may shape your future career, so you've been a bit nervous about it.

A colorful dish towel which struck your fancy at the store. It is artfully
arranged on the pedestal, serving as your current object of inspiration.

The memory board has portraits of all your loved ones who have passed on. Right
now, that includes your <grandfather>, <grandmother> and <mom>.

Grandpa died before you were born. It shows him standing outside a coal mine,
pick in hand. That was his first job, after he immigrated.

This is your grandmother's graduation picture from nursing school. She's
wearing a crisp white uniform and cap, and standing by two nuns. She passed
away shortly after her 84th birthday.

You only have vague memories of your mother, including the day this was taken.
The photo shows her at a picnic, feeding you a tiny slice of baklava.

The corner of a <recipe card> is sticking out from behind the portrait.

You snatch up the card. It's your mom's old baklava recipe!

[<Look>, <Inventory>, <Goals>; <North>; recipe card: <Examine it>, <Give it>,
<Drop it>]
> read it
This is your mom's recipe for baklava.

The card looks pretty old, and has food stains. At the bottom, it says, 'Dad's
recipe'. Huh, you never thought about it, but she must have got it from
Grandpa.

It says you need cinnamon, phyllo dough, butter, nuts, and honey. Hopefully,
Uncle Joe isn't hogging all the butter again.

[To make the baklava, you can type MAKE RECIPE in the kitchen once you have all
the ingredients.]

Dad has mellowed out a lot since you were younger. He has a full head of white
hair that he finally gave up on dyeing. He changed out of his "nice suit"
earlier so he could wear his old suit, just in case things got messy.

was?"

Your dad looks startled. "Huh. Strange woman. What did she look like?"

"I don't know, but she looked familiar. She threw a paper airplane at me," you
say.

"Did she seem dangerous?" asks Dad.

"No, it's just weird having strangers in the house," you answer.

"Well, it wouldn't be the weirdest thing that's happened here. Let me know if
you see her again, okay?" says dad.

Plastic tarps are covering parts of the walls and ceilings. Light rain begins
to drum on them.

<Uncle Joe> is slicing and dicing potatoes like an expert chef. Which, of
course, he is.

"Hey, there you are," he says, as you walk in the room. "Hope you're hungry for
later!"

In the dining half of the kitchen, the big <table> has been assembled together
for dinner. Right now the table has nothing on it.

"Did you see a strange woman upstairs today?"

Uncle Joe wipes his prodigious brow. "CJ, I haven't left this kitchen at all.
Did she look hungry? Because I think I made way too many potatoes."

"No, she didn't look hungry, but she did seem familiar. She left me a chores
list for a party," you answer.

"Oh, well that's great, actually. I thought I was the only one getting ready.
Maybe she's a guest who came early?"

"Can I help you with the potatoes?"

"Sounds great!" says Joe. He hands you a pile of potatoes and you scrub them.
He shows you some interesting cooking techniques while you're working. He can
talk about potatoes for hours, if you let him. He starts: "Potatoes are the
fruit of the earth. You can roast them, boil them, fry them, mash them."

He goes on: "There's baked potatoes, mashed potatoes. Fried potatoes: pan
fried, deep fried, stir-fried. There's potato tacos, twice-baked potatoes,
tater-tots, potatoes au gratin, chips, potato soup, potato stew, potato salad,
shrimp and potatoes, hashbrowns, steak fries. That's about it."

By now, you've washed a ton of potatoes. Uncle Joe says, "Thanks, CJ. That
helps!"

that makes you feel any better," she answers, still watching TV.

"No, that doesn't...actually, yeah, that does kind of make me feel better," you

The garage has been converted into a workshop for Ada. A <whiteboard> is in the

The family room is to the <south>.

Your cousin <Ada> is working diligently on her latest theorem in applied
homological algebra. She seems withdrawn and focused.

She notices you walk in.

"Hi, CJ," she says absent-mindedly, and keeps walking around.

Ada says, "Sorry, CJ, I'm busy. The life of a mathematician never slows down!
Well, maybe never. But at least not until I've proven that there are no zeros
off the critical line using annealing methods in numerical partial differential
equations. But enough about me. What's up?"

"Ada, did you see a strange woman upstairs?"

"Besides you and me? Not really. Actually, have you ever even been upstairs?
What with your... problem?"

"It's not a problem, Ada!" you exclaim.

"Oh, okay. That's actually a nice attitude. Anyway, no I haven't seen anyone.
If you find her, let me know and I'll go say hi," she says.

"So why do you like math so much anyway?"

"Well, CJ, who wouldn't like math? In all the other sciences, you can doubt
what your senses tell you. For all we know, nothing is real and we're just in a
simulation or something. But math is a way of organizing human thought in
consistent patterns, and it can be a source of truth even if you question
everything else," she says.

"Wow, I guess that makes sense," you say.

"Also I tried biology but it was kind of boring," she says.

"Hey, do you know where Uncle Rob is?"

"Man, why do people keep asking me that?" says Ada. "Rob is kind of...you
know..." she makes a weird gesture with her finger, like an infinity sign, and
leans forward to whisper, "non-spatio-temporally anchored. You know. Like you.
And our other cousin."

She gives you a knowing nod and goes back to work.

"Ada, I seem to be traveling through time. Do you know anything about that?"

"Haha! Oh, CJ, you're such a kidder!" she says. "You know that you're one of
the few members of the family with spatio-temporal disjunction. I've explained
it to you many times before! And I specifically recall how disappointed you
were when your beautiful and wondrous ability could be reduced to a simple and
mundane 4-dimensional explanation! Oh, how the joy of mystery breaks down in
the face of pure reason," she says, shaking her head.

"Oh, yeah," you say. "I completely forgot about my spatio-temporal disjunction.
Thanks for reminding me!"

"Hey, I know this is weird, but do you remember much about my mom?"

"I only met her when I was very little. It might be better to ask your dad or
Joe or someone," she says a little uncomfortably.

"That's why I wanted to talk to you; they knew her more and I feel like they
would just get sad if I asked. What do you remember about her?" you say.

"Oh, gosh. Well, I remember that she used to tell me stories when I was bored,
like from Greek mythology. Cyclops and stuff. That was pretty cool. And she
liked the color blue, and I swear I saw her take a pan out of the oven with her
bare hands once. Although that doesn't really make sense given the laws of
thermodynamics. Does that help?" she asks.

"Yeah, that's great. Thanks Ada!" you say.

have everybody in the house together." He looks over at the memory board.
"Well, most people. Your mom was really tough, you know. That's why we were all
so shocked when she got breast cancer. But before she went, she was the
strongest one in the house. Had a temper, too. She never hit you or me, but oh,
would she shout when she was mad."

He looks at the memory board, and adds, "Your grandfather was pretty much the
same, like two peas in a pod. I heard they had some legendary arguments. But I
only barely knew him, and by then he had mellowed out a ton. He had cancer,
too, but it was lung cancer. You should probably get that checked out some day
for all that stuff," he says. "But you can worry about that when you're older."

train my robot with. And it can't be digital, I've had enough of that. I'm
looking for something imperfect, like someone's journals or a finished book of

"Hmmm," you say, "sounds like something my dad would have."

dad. Kind of like brothers!"

Ada's future has changed.

She presses a button, and Rob lights up.

"Hello, CJ. It's a pleasure to see you. Do you have any food? I am quite
hungry," says Rob.

Ada smacks her forehead. "Of course! I forgot about dinner. Here, take Rob and
let me know when everyone else gets here! I'm going to go wash up," she says,
and walks into the house.

the solar system
Near ten thousand years before
In their single starcrossed scout ships
Mining ast'roids, spinning lore.

Then one true courageous miner
Spied a spaceship from the stars
Boarded he that alien liner
Out beyond the orb of Mars.

Yes, that ship was filled with danger
Mighty monsters barred his way
Yet he solved the alien myst'ries
Mining quite a lode that day.

O, they ruled the solar system
Near ten thousand years before
'Til one brave advent'rous spirit
Brought that mighty ship to shore."

Look who it is! It's your young cousin Emma!

"We finally made it! I brought a gift for Grandma, and a toy for later," she
says. She holds up a wrapped present and a dollhouse. She looks at everyone
else in the room behind you: "Hey grandma! Hey Uncle Rob!" she says.

"Hi, Emma!" says Grandma from her chair. "Come on in! We're just heading in to
dinner."

Emma walks past you while Uncle Rob helps Grandma up and into the kitchen.

Your dad pokes his head out of the office. "Everyone's here already? Great! I
can smell the baklava." He walks into the kitchen, and you hear Ada in there,
too.

everyone.

You take your place at the table while Uncle Joe slices everything up.

Ada stands and says, "Here's to Grandma!"

"To grandma!" you all shout, and sit down to eat.

In the dining half of the kitchen, the big <table> has been assembled together

familiar, but I couldn't place her," you say.

"Really? What did the note card say?" asks Emma.

You show her the card.

"That gives me an idea," says Emma. She pulls out a card of her own and takes
notes.

Ada looks over, and says, "Hey, are you guys resolving a spatio-temporal
paradox?"

"I guess?" says Emma. She runs out of the room. You hear feet on the stairs and
floorboards creaking above you. You hear a window opening, and a woman
shouting, "There you go, CJ! See you at dinner!" Then there are footsteps
coming down the stairs.

Emma comes back in, looking decidedly out of sorts. "You've got to get those
stairs fixed. Whew!"
