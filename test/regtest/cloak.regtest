Hurrying through the rainswept November night, you're glad to see the bright
lights of the Opera House. It's surprising that there aren't more people about
but, hey, what do you expect in a cheap demo game...?


A port of Roger Firth's reference game by Linus Ã…kesson.

You are standing in a spacious hall, splendidly decorated in red and gold, with
glittering chandeliers overhead. The entrance from the street is to the north,
and there are doorways south and west.

You walk west.


The walls of this small room were clearly once lined with hooks, though now only

You have no possessions. You're wearing a velvet cloak.

> remove cloak


You take off the velvet cloak.

> put cloak on hook


You put the velvet cloak on the small brass hook.

(Your score has gone up by one point.)

the north, is completely empty. There seems to be some sort of message scrawled
in the sawdust on the floor.

> x message


The message, neatly marked in the sawdust, reads...

Thanks for playing!
